## Content

After [pre-rasterization shader stages](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization), the following fixed-function operations are applied to
vertices of the resulting primitives:

* 
Transform feedback (see [Transform    Feedback](#vertexpostproc-transform-feedback))

* 
Viewport swizzle (see [Viewport    Swizzle](#vertexpostproc-viewport-swizzle))

* 
Flat shading (see [Flat Shading](#vertexpostproc-flatshading)).

* 
Primitive clipping, including application-defined half-spaces (see
[Primitive Clipping](#vertexpostproc-clipping)).

* 
Shader output attribute clipping (see
[Clipping Shader Outputs](#vertexpostproc-clipping-shader-outputs)).

* 
Clip space W scaling (see [Controlling    Viewport W Scaling](#vertexpostproc-viewportwscaling)).

* 
Perspective division on clip coordinates (see
[Coordinate Transformations](#vertexpostproc-coord-transform)).

* 
Viewport mapping, including depth range scaling (see
[Controlling the Viewport](#vertexpostproc-viewport)).

* 
Front face determination for polygon primitives (see
[Basic Polygon Rasterization](primsrast.html#primsrast-polygons-basic)).

Next, rasterization is performed on primitives as described in chapter
[Rasterization](primsrast.html#primsrast).

Before any other fixed-function vertex post-processing, vertex outputs from
the last shader in the
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) **can** be written out to one or more transform feedback buffers bound
to the command buffer.
To capture vertex outputs the last
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) shader **must** be declared with the `Xfb` execution mode.
Outputs decorated with `XfbBuffer` will be written out to the
corresponding transform feedback buffers bound to the command buffer when
transform feedback is active.
Transform feedback buffers are bound to the command buffer by using
[vkCmdBindTransformFeedbackBuffersEXT](#vkCmdBindTransformFeedbackBuffersEXT).
Transform feedback is made active by calling
[vkCmdBeginTransformFeedbackEXT](#vkCmdBeginTransformFeedbackEXT) and made inactive by calling
[vkCmdEndTransformFeedbackEXT](#vkCmdEndTransformFeedbackEXT).
After vertex data is written it is possible to use
[vkCmdDrawIndirectByteCountEXT](drawing.html#vkCmdDrawIndirectByteCountEXT) to start a new draw where the
`vertexCount` is derived from the number of bytes written by a previous
transform feedback.

When an individual point, line, or triangle primitive reaches the transform
feedback stage while transform feedback is active, the values of the
specified output variables are assembled into primitives and appended to the
bound transform feedback buffers.
After activating transform feedback, the values of the first assembled
primitive are written at the starting offsets of the bound transform
feedback buffers, and subsequent primitives are appended to the buffer.
If the optional `pCounterBuffers` and `pCounterBufferOffsets`
parameters are specified, the starting points within the transform feedback
buffers are adjusted so data is appended to the previously written values
indicated by the value stored by the implementation in the counter buffer.

For multi-vertex primitives, all values for a given vertex are written
before writing values for any other vertex.
When the [`transformFeedbackPreservesProvokingVertex`](features.html#features-transformFeedbackPreservesProvokingVertex) feature is not enabled,
implementations
**may** write out any vertex within the primitive first, but all subsequent
vertices for that primitive **must** be written out in a consistent winding
order defined as follows:

* 
If neither [geometry](geometry.html#geometry) or [tessellation    shading](tessellation.html#tessellation) is active, vertices within a primitive are appended according
to the winding order described by the [    primitive topology](drawing.html#drawing-primitive-topologies) defined by the
[VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo](drawing.html#VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo):`topology` used to
execute the [drawing command](drawing.html#drawing).

* 
If [geometry shading](geometry.html#geometry) is active, vertices within a primitive
are appended according to the winding order described by the
[primitive topology](drawing.html#drawing-primitive-topologies) defined by the
[`OutputPoints`](drawing.html#drawing-point-lists), [    `OutputLineStrip`](drawing.html#drawing-line-strips), or [    `OutputTriangleStrip`](drawing.html#drawing-triangle-strips) execution mode.

* 
If [tessellation shading](tessellation.html#tessellation) is active but
[geometry shading](geometry.html#geometry) is not, vertices within a primitive are
appended according to the winding order defined by
[triangle tessellation](tessellation.html#tessellation-triangle-tessellation),
[quad tessellation](tessellation.html#tessellation-quad-tessellation), and
[isoline tessellation](tessellation.html#tessellation-isoline-tessellation).

When the [`transformFeedbackPreservesProvokingVertex`](features.html#features-transformFeedbackPreservesProvokingVertex) feature is enabled, then
in addition to writing vertices with a consistent winding order, the vertex
order **must** preserve the [provoking vertex](#vertexpostproc-flatshading) of
each primitive:

* 
When the
[pipeline’s    provoking vertex mode](#VkPipelineRasterizationProvokingVertexStateCreateInfoEXT) is
`VK_PROVOKING_VERTEX_MODE_FIRST_VERTEX_EXT`, the primitive’s
provoking vertex **must** be the first vertex written.

* 
When the
[pipeline’s    provoking vertex mode](#VkPipelineRasterizationProvokingVertexStateCreateInfoEXT) is
`VK_PROVOKING_VERTEX_MODE_LAST_VERTEX_EXT`, the primitive’s
provoking vertex **must** be the last vertex written.

If [`transformFeedbackPreservesTriangleFanProvokingVertex`](limits.html#limits-transformFeedbackPreservesTriangleFanProvokingVertex) is
`VK_FALSE`, neither [geometry](geometry.html#geometry) nor [tessellation](tessellation.html#tessellation) shading is active, and the [primitive topology](drawing.html#drawing-primitive-topologies) is `VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_FAN`, then the
first vertex written from each primitive is implementation-defined even when
the [`transformFeedbackPreservesProvokingVertex`](features.html#features-transformFeedbackPreservesProvokingVertex) feature is enabled.

When capturing vertices, the stride associated with each transform feedback
buffer, as indicated by the `XfbStride` decoration, indicates the number
of bytes of storage reserved for each vertex in the transform feedback
buffer.
For every vertex captured, each output attribute with a `Offset`
decoration will be written to the storage reserved for the vertex at the
associated transform feedback buffer.
When writing output variables that are arrays or structures, individual
array elements or structure members are written tightly packed in order.
For vector types, individual components are written in order.
For matrix types, outputs are written as an array of column vectors.

If any component of an output with an assigned transform feedback offset was
not written to by its shader, the value recorded for that component is
**undefined**, and the primitives needed and primitives written counts in the
corresponding `VK_QUERY_TYPE_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_STREAM_EXT` query will
increment as normal.
All components of an output variable **must** be written at an offset aligned
to the size of the component.
The size of each component of an output variable **must** be at least 32-bits.
When capturing a vertex, any portion of the reserved storage not associated
with an output variable with an assigned transform feedback offset will be
unmodified.

When transform feedback is inactive, no vertices are recorded.
If there is a valid counter buffer handle and counter buffer offset in the
`pCounterBuffers` and `pCounterBufferOffsets` arrays, writes to the
corresponding transform feedback buffer will start at the byte offset
represented by the value stored in the counter buffer location.

Individual lines or triangles of a strip or fan primitive will be extracted
and recorded separately.
Incomplete primitives are not recorded.

When using a geometry shader that emits vertices to multiple vertex streams,
a primitive will be assembled and output for each stream when there are
enough vertices emitted for the output primitive type.
All outputs assigned to a given transform feedback buffer are required to
come from a single vertex stream.

The sizes of the transform feedback buffers are defined by the
[vkCmdBindTransformFeedbackBuffersEXT](#vkCmdBindTransformFeedbackBuffersEXT) `pSizes` parameter for each
of the bound buffers, or the size of the bound buffer, whichever is the
lesser.
If there is less space remaining in any of the transform feedback buffers
than the size of all of the vertex data for that primitive based on the
`XfbStride` for that `XfbBuffer` then no vertex data of that primitive
is recorded in any transform feedback buffer, and the value for the number
of primitives written in the corresponding
`VK_QUERY_TYPE_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_STREAM_EXT` query for all transform
feedback buffers is no longer incremented.

Any outputs made to a `XfbBuffer` that is not bound to a transform
feedback buffer is ignored.

To bind transform feedback buffers to a command buffer for use in subsequent
drawing commands, call:

// Provided by VK_EXT_transform_feedback
void vkCmdBindTransformFeedbackBuffersEXT(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    firstBinding,
    uint32_t                                    bindingCount,
    const VkBuffer*                             pBuffers,
    const VkDeviceSize*                         pOffsets,
    const VkDeviceSize*                         pSizes);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command is
recorded.

* 
`firstBinding` is the index of the first transform feedback binding
whose state is updated by the command.

* 
`bindingCount` is the number of transform feedback bindings whose
state is updated by the command.

* 
`pBuffers` is a pointer to an array of buffer handles.

* 
`pOffsets` is a pointer to an array of buffer offsets.

* 
`pSizes` is `NULL` or a pointer to an array of `VkDeviceSize`
buffer sizes, specifying the maximum number of bytes to capture to the
corresponding transform feedback buffer.
If `pSizes` is `NULL`, or the value of the `pSizes` array
element is `VK_WHOLE_SIZE`, then the maximum number of bytes
captured will be the size of the corresponding buffer minus the buffer
offset.

The values taken from elements i of `pBuffers`, `pOffsets` and
`pSizes` replace the current state for the transform feedback binding
`firstBinding` +  i, for i in [0,
`bindingCount`).
The transform feedback binding is updated to start at the offset indicated
by `pOffsets`[i] from the start of the buffer `pBuffers`[i].

Transform feedback for specific transform feedback buffers is made active by
calling:

// Provided by VK_EXT_transform_feedback
void vkCmdBeginTransformFeedbackEXT(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    firstCounterBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    counterBufferCount,
    const VkBuffer*                             pCounterBuffers,
    const VkDeviceSize*                         pCounterBufferOffsets);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command is
recorded.

* 
`firstCounterBuffer` is the index of the first transform feedback
buffer corresponding to `pCounterBuffers`[0] and
`pCounterBufferOffsets`[0].

* 
`counterBufferCount` is the size of the `pCounterBuffers` and
`pCounterBufferOffsets` arrays.

* 
`pCounterBuffers` is `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
[VkBuffer](resources.html#VkBuffer) handles to counter buffers.
Each buffer contains a 4 byte integer value representing the byte offset
from the start of the corresponding transform feedback buffer from where
to start capturing vertex data.
If the byte offset stored to the counter buffer location was done using
[vkCmdEndTransformFeedbackEXT](#vkCmdEndTransformFeedbackEXT) it can be used to resume transform
feedback from the previous location.
In that case, a pipeline barrier is required between the calls to
`vkCmdEndTransformFeedbackEXT` and
`vkCmdBeginTransformFeedbackEXT`, with
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BIT_EXT` as the source and
destination stages,
`VK_ACCESS_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_COUNTER_WRITE_BIT_EXT` as the source
access and `VK_ACCESS_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_COUNTER_READ_BIT_EXT` as
the destination access.
If `pCounterBuffers` is `NULL`, then transform feedback will start
capturing vertex data to byte offset zero in all bound transform
feedback buffers.
For each element of `pCounterBuffers` that is [VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE),
transform feedback will start capturing vertex data to byte zero in the
corresponding bound transform feedback buffer.

* 
`pCounterBufferOffsets` is `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
`VkDeviceSize` values specifying offsets within each of the
`pCounterBuffers` where the counter values were previously written.
The location in each counter buffer at these offsets **must** be large
enough to contain 4 bytes of data.
This data is the number of bytes captured by the previous transform
feedback to this buffer.
If `pCounterBufferOffsets` is `NULL`, then it is assumed the offsets
are zero.

The active transform feedback buffers will capture primitives emitted from
the corresponding `XfbBuffer` in the bound graphics pipeline.
Any `XfbBuffer` emitted that does not output to an active transform
feedback buffer will not be captured.

Each primitive sent to a given viewport has a swizzle and **optional** negation
applied to its clip coordinates.
The swizzle that is applied depends on the viewport index, and is controlled
by the `VkPipelineViewportSwizzleStateCreateInfoNV` pipeline state:

// Provided by VK_NV_viewport_swizzle
typedef struct VkPipelineViewportSwizzleStateCreateInfoNV {
    VkStructureType                                sType;

} VkPipelineViewportSwizzleStateCreateInfoNV;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`flags` is reserved for future use.

* 
`viewportCount` is the number of viewport swizzles used by the

// Provided by VK_NV_viewport_swizzle
typedef VkFlags VkPipelineViewportSwizzleStateCreateFlagsNV;

`VkPipelineViewportSwizzleStateCreateFlagsNV` is a bitmask type for
setting a mask, but is currently reserved for future use.

The `VkPipelineViewportSwizzleStateCreateInfoNV` state is set by adding
this structure to the `pNext` chain of a
`VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo` structure and setting the graphics
pipeline state with [vkCreateGraphicsPipelines](pipelines.html#vkCreateGraphicsPipelines).

To [dynamically set](pipelines.html#pipelines-dynamic-state) the viewport swizzle state,
call:

// Provided by VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 with VK_NV_viewport_swizzle, VK_EXT_shader_object with VK_NV_viewport_swizzle
void vkCmdSetViewportSwizzleNV(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,

    const VkViewportSwizzleNV*                  pViewportSwizzles);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be
recorded.

* 
`firstViewport` is the index of the first viewport whose parameters
are updated by the command.

* 
`viewportCount` is the number of viewports whose parameters are
updated by the command.

* 
`pViewportSwizzles` is a pointer to an array of
[VkViewportSwizzleNV](#VkViewportSwizzleNV) structures specifying viewport swizzles.

This command sets the viewport swizzle state for subsequent drawing commands
when drawing using [shader objects](shaders.html#shaders-objects), or
when the graphics pipeline is created with
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT_SWIZZLE_NV` set in
[VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo](pipelines.html#VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo)::`pDynamicStates`.
Otherwise, this state is specified by the

Each viewport specified from 0 to `viewportCount` - 1 has its x,y,z,w
swizzle state set to the corresponding `x`, `y`, `z` and `w`
in the [VkViewportSwizzleNV](#VkViewportSwizzleNV) structure.
Each component is of type [VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV](#VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV), which
determines the type of swizzle for that component.
The value of `x` computes the new x component of the position as:

if (x == VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_POSITIVE_X_NV) x' = x;
if (x == VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_NEGATIVE_X_NV) x' = -x;
if (x == VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_POSITIVE_Y_NV) x' = y;
if (x == VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_NEGATIVE_Y_NV) x' = -y;
if (x == VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_POSITIVE_Z_NV) x' = z;
if (x == VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_NEGATIVE_Z_NV) x' = -z;
if (x == VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_POSITIVE_W_NV) x' = w;
if (x == VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_NEGATIVE_W_NV) x' = -w;

Similar selections are performed for the `y`, `z`, and `w`
coordinates.
This swizzling is applied before clipping and perspective divide.
If the swizzle for an active viewport index is not specified, the swizzle
for `x` is `VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_POSITIVE_X_NV`, `y`
is `VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_POSITIVE_Y_NV`, `z` is
`VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_POSITIVE_Z_NV` and `w` is
`VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_POSITIVE_W_NV`.

Viewport swizzle parameters are specified by setting the `pNext` pointer
of `VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo` to point to a
`VkPipelineViewportSwizzleStateCreateInfoNV` structure.
[VkPipelineViewportSwizzleStateCreateInfoNV](#VkPipelineViewportSwizzleStateCreateInfoNV) uses
`VkViewportSwizzleNV` to set the viewport swizzle parameters.

The `VkViewportSwizzleNV` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_NV_viewport_swizzle
typedef struct VkViewportSwizzleNV {
    VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV    x;
    VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV    y;
    VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV    z;
    VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV    w;
} VkViewportSwizzleNV;

* 
`x` is a [VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV](#VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV) value specifying the
swizzle operation to apply to the x component of the primitive

* 
`y` is a [VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV](#VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV) value specifying the
swizzle operation to apply to the y component of the primitive

* 
`z` is a [VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV](#VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV) value specifying the
swizzle operation to apply to the z component of the primitive

Possible values of the [VkViewportSwizzleNV](#VkViewportSwizzleNV)::`x`, `y`, `z`,
and `w` members, specifying swizzling of the corresponding components of
primitives, are:

// Provided by VK_NV_viewport_swizzle
typedef enum VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV {
    VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_POSITIVE_X_NV = 0,
    VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_NEGATIVE_X_NV = 1,

    VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_POSITIVE_W_NV = 6,
    VK_VIEWPORT_COORDINATE_SWIZZLE_NEGATIVE_W_NV = 7,
} VkViewportCoordinateSwizzleNV;

These values are described in detail in [Viewport Swizzle](#vertexpostproc-viewport-swizzle).

*Flat shading* a vertex output attribute means to assign all vertices of the
primitive the same value for that output.
The output values assigned are those of the *provoking vertex* of the
primitive.
Flat shading is applied to those vertex attributes that
[match](interfaces.html#interfaces-iointerfaces-matching) fragment input attributes which
are decorated as `Flat`.

If neither
[mesh](VK_NV_mesh_shader/mesh.html#mesh),
[geometry](geometry.html#geometry) nor [tessellation shading](tessellation.html#tessellation) is active,
the provoking vertex is determined by the [primitive topology](drawing.html#drawing-primitive-topologies) defined by
[VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo](drawing.html#VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo):`topology` used to execute
the [drawing command](drawing.html#drawing).

If a shader using `MeshNV` `Execution` `Model` is active, the provoking
vertex is determined by the [primitive topology](drawing.html#drawing-primitive-topologies) defined by the [`OutputPoints`](drawing.html#drawing-point-lists),
[`OutputLinesNV`](drawing.html#drawing-line-lists), or [`OutputTrianglesNV`](drawing.html#drawing-triangle-lists) execution mode.

If a shader using `MeshEXT` `Execution` `Model` is active, the provoking
vertex is determined by the [primitive topology](drawing.html#drawing-primitive-topologies) defined by the [`OutputPoints`](drawing.html#drawing-point-lists),
[`OutputLinesEXT`](drawing.html#drawing-line-lists), or [`OutputTrianglesEXT`](drawing.html#drawing-triangle-lists) execution mode.

If [geometry shading](geometry.html#geometry) is active, the provoking vertex is
determined by the [primitive topology](drawing.html#drawing-primitive-topologies)
defined by the [`OutputPoints`](drawing.html#drawing-point-lists),
[`OutputLineStrip`](drawing.html#drawing-line-strips), or [`OutputTriangleStrip`](drawing.html#drawing-triangle-strips) execution mode.

If [tessellation shading](tessellation.html#tessellation) is active but [geometry shading](geometry.html#geometry) is not, the provoking vertex **may** be any of the vertices in each
primitive.

For a given primitive topology, the pipeline’s provoking vertex mode
determines which vertex is the provoking vertex.
To specify the provoking vertex mode, include a
`VkPipelineRasterizationProvokingVertexStateCreateInfoEXT` structure in
the [VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo](primsrast.html#VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo)::`pNext` chain when
creating the pipeline.

The `VkPipelineRasterizationProvokingVertexStateCreateInfoEXT` structure
is defined as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_provoking_vertex
typedef struct VkPipelineRasterizationProvokingVertexStateCreateInfoEXT {
    VkStructureType             sType;
    const void*                 pNext;
    VkProvokingVertexModeEXT    provokingVertexMode;
} VkPipelineRasterizationProvokingVertexStateCreateInfoEXT;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`provokingVertexMode` is a [VkProvokingVertexModeEXT](#VkProvokingVertexModeEXT) value
selecting the provoking vertex mode.

If this structure is not provided when creating the pipeline, the pipeline
will use the `VK_PROVOKING_VERTEX_MODE_FIRST_VERTEX_EXT` mode.

If the [`provokingVertexModePerPipeline`](limits.html#limits-provokingVertexModePerPipeline) limit is `VK_FALSE`, then all
pipelines bound within a render pass instance **must** have the same
`provokingVertexMode`.

provoking vertex is the last non-adjacency vertex in the list of

To [dynamically set](pipelines.html#pipelines-dynamic-state) the

`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be

Primitives are culled against the *cull volume* and then clipped to the
*clip volume*.
In clip coordinates, the *view volume* is defined by:

  

  

where
if
[VkPipelineViewportDepthClipControlCreateInfoEXT](#VkPipelineViewportDepthClipControlCreateInfoEXT)::`negativeOneToOne`
is `VK_TRUE` zm is equal to -wc otherwise
zm is equal to zero.

This view volume **can** be further restricted by as many as
`VkPhysicalDeviceLimits`::`maxClipDistances` application-defined
half-spaces.

The cull volume is the intersection of up to
`VkPhysicalDeviceLimits`::`maxCullDistances` application-defined
half-spaces (if no application-defined cull half-spaces are enabled, culling
against the cull volume is skipped).

A shader **must** write a single cull distance for each enabled cull half-space
to elements of the `CullDistance` array.
If the cull distance for any enabled cull half-space is negative for all of
the vertices of the primitive under consideration, the primitive is
discarded.
Otherwise the primitive is clipped against the clip volume as defined below.

The clip volume is the intersection of up to
`VkPhysicalDeviceLimits`::`maxClipDistances` application-defined
half-spaces with the view volume (if no application-defined clip half-spaces
are enabled, the clip volume is the view volume).

A shader **must** write a single clip distance for each enabled clip half-space
to elements of the `ClipDistance` array.
Clip half-space i is then given by the set of points satisfying the
inequality

ci(**P**) ≥ 0

where ci(**P**) is the clip distance i at point **P**.
For point primitives, ci(**P**) is simply the clip distance for the
vertex in question.
For line and triangle primitives, per-vertex clip distances are interpolated
using a weighted mean, with weights derived according to the algorithms
described in sections [Basic Line Segment Rasterization](primsrast.html#primsrast-lines-basic) and [Basic Polygon Rasterization](primsrast.html#primsrast-polygons-basic), using the perspective interpolation equations.

The number of application-defined clip and cull half-spaces that are enabled
is determined by the explicit size of the built-in arrays `ClipDistance`

of the entry point of the final shader stage before clipping.

If [VkPipelineRasterizationDepthClipStateCreateInfoEXT](primsrast.html#VkPipelineRasterizationDepthClipStateCreateInfoEXT) is present in

Otherwise, this state is specified by the

used to create the currently active pipeline.

If the depth clamping state is changed dynamically, and the pipeline was not
created with `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_CLIP_ENABLE_EXT` enabled, then
depth clipping is enabled when depth clamping is disabled and vice versa.

When depth clipping is disabled, the plane equation

zm ≤ zc ≤ wc

(see the clip volume definition above) is ignored by view volume clipping
(effectively, there is no near or far plane clipping).

If the primitive under consideration is a point or line segment, then
clipping passes it unchanged if its vertices lie entirely within the clip
volume.

Possible values of
[VkPhysicalDevicePointClippingProperties](limits.html#VkPhysicalDevicePointClippingProperties)::`pointClippingBehavior`,
specifying clipping behavior of a point primitive whose vertex lies outside
the clip volume, are:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef enum VkPointClippingBehavior {
    VK_POINT_CLIPPING_BEHAVIOR_ALL_CLIP_PLANES = 0,
    VK_POINT_CLIPPING_BEHAVIOR_USER_CLIP_PLANES_ONLY = 1,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance2
    VK_POINT_CLIPPING_BEHAVIOR_ALL_CLIP_PLANES_KHR = VK_POINT_CLIPPING_BEHAVIOR_ALL_CLIP_PLANES,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance2
    VK_POINT_CLIPPING_BEHAVIOR_USER_CLIP_PLANES_ONLY_KHR = VK_POINT_CLIPPING_BEHAVIOR_USER_CLIP_PLANES_ONLY,
} VkPointClippingBehavior;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance2
typedef VkPointClippingBehavior VkPointClippingBehaviorKHR;

* 
`VK_POINT_CLIPPING_BEHAVIOR_ALL_CLIP_PLANES` specifies that the
primitive is discarded if the vertex lies outside any clip plane,
including the planes bounding the view volume.

* 
`VK_POINT_CLIPPING_BEHAVIOR_USER_CLIP_PLANES_ONLY` specifies that
the primitive is discarded only if the vertex lies outside any user clip
plane.

If either of a line segment’s vertices lie outside of the clip volume, the
line segment **may** be clipped, with new vertex coordinates computed for each
vertex that lies outside the clip volume.
A clipped line segment endpoint lies on both the original line segment and
the boundary of the clip volume.

This clipping produces a value, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, for each clipped
vertex.
If the coordinates of a clipped vertex are **P** and the unclipped
line segment’s vertex coordinates are **P**1 and **P**2,
then t satisfies the following equation

**P** = t **P**1 +  (1-t) **P**2.

t is used to clip vertex output attributes as described in
[Clipping Shader Outputs](#vertexpostproc-clipping-shader-outputs).

If the primitive is a polygon, it passes unchanged if every one of its edges
lies entirely inside the clip volume, and is either clipped or discarded
otherwise.
If the edges of the polygon intersect the boundary of the clip volume, the
intersecting edges are reconnected by new edges that lie along the boundary
of the clip volume - in some cases requiring the introduction of new
vertices into a polygon.

If a polygon intersects an edge of the clip volume’s boundary, the clipped
polygon **must** include a point on this boundary edge.

Primitives rendered with application-defined half-spaces **must** satisfy a
complementarity criterion.
Suppose a series of primitives is drawn where each vertex i has a
single specified clip distance di (or a number of similarly
specified clip distances, if multiple half-spaces are enabled).
Next, suppose that the same series of primitives are drawn again with each
such clip distance replaced by -di (and the graphics pipeline is
otherwise the same).
In this case, primitives **must** not be missing any pixels, and pixels **must**
not be drawn twice in regions where those primitives are cut by the clip
planes.

Next, vertex output attributes are clipped.
The output values associated with a vertex that lies within the clip volume
are unaffected by clipping.
If a primitive is clipped, however, the output values assigned to vertices
produced by clipping are clipped.

Let the output values assigned to the two vertices **P**1 and
**P**2 of an unclipped edge be **c**1 and **c**2.
The value of t (see [Primitive Clipping](#vertexpostproc-clipping))
for a clipped point **P** is used to obtain the output value
associated with **P** as

**c** = t **c**1 +  (1-t) **c**2.

(Multiplying an output value by a scalar means multiplying each of *x*, *y*,
*z*, and *w* by the scalar.)

Since this computation is performed in clip space before division by
wc, clipped output values are perspective-correct.

Polygon clipping creates a clipped vertex along an edge of the clip volume’s
boundary.
This situation is handled by noting that polygon clipping proceeds by
clipping against one half-space at a time.
Output value clipping is done in the same way, so that clipped points always
occur at the intersection of polygon edges (possibly already clipped) with
the clip volume’s boundary.

For vertex output attributes whose matching fragment input attributes are
decorated with `NoPerspective`, the value of t used to obtain the
output value associated with **P** will be adjusted to produce results
that vary linearly in framebuffer space.

Output attributes of integer or unsigned integer type **must** always be flat
shaded.
Flat shaded attributes are constant over the primitive being rasterized (see
[Basic Line Segment Rasterization](primsrast.html#primsrast-lines-basic) and
[Basic Polygon Rasterization](primsrast.html#primsrast-polygons-basic)), and no
interpolation is performed.
The output value **c** is taken from either **c**1 or
**c**2, since flat shading has already occurred and the two values
are identical.

If viewport **W** scaling is enabled, the **W** component of the clip coordinate
is modified by the provided coefficients from the corresponding viewport as

Both [VkPipelineViewportWScalingStateCreateInfoNV](#VkPipelineViewportWScalingStateCreateInfoNV) and

`xcoeff` and `ycoeff` are the viewport’s W scaling factor for x
and y respectively.

*Clip coordinates* for a vertex result from shader execution, which yields a
vertex coordinate `Position`.

Perspective division on clip coordinates yields *normalized device
coordinates*, followed by a *viewport* transformation (see
[Controlling the Viewport](#vertexpostproc-viewport)) to convert these
coordinates into *framebuffer coordinates*.

If a vertex in clip coordinates has a position given by

A *render pass transform* **can** be enabled for render pass instances.

When render pass transform is enabled for a render pass instance, the
following additional features are enabled:

* 
Each [VkViewport](#VkViewport) specified by either
[VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo](#VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo)::`pViewports` or
[vkCmdSetViewport](#vkCmdSetViewport) will have its width/height (px, py) and
its center (ox, oy) similarly transformed by the
implementation.

* 
Each scissor specified by
[VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo](#VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo)::`pScissors` or
[vkCmdSetScissor](fragops.html#vkCmdSetScissor) will have its (offsetx, offsety) and
(extentx, extenty) similarly transformed by the
implementation.

* 
The `renderArea` specified in
[VkCommandBufferInheritanceRenderPassTransformInfoQCOM](cmdbuffers.html#VkCommandBufferInheritanceRenderPassTransformInfoQCOM) and
[VkRenderPassBeginInfo](renderpass.html#VkRenderPassBeginInfo) will be similarly transformed by the
implementation.

* 
The (x, y) components of shader variables with built-in
decorations `FragCoord`, `SamplePosition`, or `PointCoord` will
be similarly transformed by the implementation.

* 
The (x,y) components of the `offset` operand of the
`InterpolateAtOffset` extended instruction will be similarly
transformed by the implementation.

* 
The values returned by SPIR-V [    derivative instructions](shaders.html#shaders-derivative-operations) `OpDPdx`, `OpDPdy`, `OpDPdxCourse`,
`OpDPdyCourse`, `OpDPdxFine`, `OpDPdyFine` will be similarly
transformed by the implementation.

The net result of the above, is that applications **can** act as if rendering
to a framebuffer oriented with the
[VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR](VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR)::`currentTransform`.
In other words, applications **can** act as if the presentation engine will be
performing the transformation of the swapchain image after rendering and
prior to presentation to the user.
In fact, the transformation of the various items cited above are being
handled by the implementation as the rendering takes place.

The viewport transformation is determined by the selected viewport’s width
and height in pixels, px and py, respectively, and its
center (ox, oy) (also in pixels), as well as its depth range min
and max determining a depth range scale value pz and a depth range
bias value oz (defined below).
The vertex’s framebuffer coordinates (xf, yf) and depth zf
are given by

xf = (px / 2) xd +  ox

yf = (py / 2) yd +  oy

zf = pz × zd +  oz

Multiple viewports are available, numbered zero up to
`VkPhysicalDeviceLimits`::`maxViewports` minus one.
The number of viewports used by a pipeline is controlled by the
`viewportCount` member of the `VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo`
structure used in pipeline creation.

xf and yf have limited precision, where the number of
fractional bits retained is specified by
`VkPhysicalDeviceLimits`::`subPixelPrecisionBits`.
When rasterizing [line segments](primsrast.html#primsrast-lines), the number of fractional
bits is specified by
`VkPhysicalDeviceLineRasterizationProperties`::`lineSubPixelPrecisionBits`.

The `VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo {
    VkStructureType                       sType;
    const void*                           pNext;
    VkPipelineViewportStateCreateFlags    flags;

    const VkViewport*                     pViewports;
    uint32_t                              scissorCount;
    const VkRect2D*                       pScissors;
} VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`flags` is reserved for future use.

* 
`viewportCount` is the number of viewports used by the pipeline.

* 
`pViewports` is a pointer to an array of [VkViewport](#VkViewport)
structures, defining the viewport transforms.
If the viewport state is dynamic, this member is ignored.

* 
`scissorCount` is the number of [scissors](fragops.html#fragops-scissor) and
**must** match the number of viewports.

* 
`pScissors` is a pointer to an array of [VkRect2D](fundamentals.html#VkRect2D) structures
defining the rectangular bounds of the scissor for the corresponding
viewport.
If the scissor state is dynamic, this member is ignored.

`VkPipelineViewportStateCreateFlags` is a bitmask type for setting a
mask, but is currently reserved for future use.

A *[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization)* **can** direct each primitive to zero or more viewports.
The destination viewports for a primitive are selected by the last active
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) that has an output variable decorated with `ViewportIndex`
(selecting a single viewport) or `ViewportMaskNV` (selecting multiple
viewports).
The viewport transform uses the viewport corresponding to either the value
assigned to `ViewportIndex` or one of the bits set in
`ViewportMaskNV`, and taken from an implementation-dependent vertex of
each primitive.
If `ViewportIndex` or any of the bits in `ViewportMaskNV` are outside
the range zero to `viewportCount` minus one for a primitive, or if the
last active [pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) did not assign a value to either `ViewportIndex` or
`ViewportMaskNV` for all vertices of a primitive due to flow control, the
values resulting from the viewport transformation of the vertices of such
primitives are **undefined**.
If the last [pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) does not have an output decorated with `ViewportIndex` or
`ViewportMaskNV`, the viewport numbered zero is used by the viewport
transformation.

A single vertex **can** be used in more than one individual primitive, in
primitives such as `VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_STRIP`.
In this case, the viewport transformation is applied separately for each
primitive.

parameters, call:

when the graphics pipeline is created with `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT`
set in [VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo](pipelines.html#VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo)::`pDynamicStates`.
Otherwise, this state is specified by the

The framebuffer depth coordinate `z`f **may** be represented using
either a fixed-point or floating-point representation.
However, a floating-point representation **must** be used if the depth/stencil
attachment has a floating-point depth component.
If an m-bit fixed-point representation is used, we assume that it
represents each value   , where k ∈ {
0, 1, …​, 2m-1 }, as k (e.g. 1.0 is represented in binary as a
string of all ones).

The viewport parameters shown in the above equations are found from these
values as

ox = `x` +  `width` / 2

oy = `y` +  `height` / 2

oz = `minDepth`
(or (`maxDepth` + `minDepth`) / 2 if
[VkPipelineViewportDepthClipControlCreateInfoEXT](#VkPipelineViewportDepthClipControlCreateInfoEXT)::`negativeOneToOne`
is `VK_TRUE`)

px = `width`

py = `height`

pz = `maxDepth` - `minDepth`
(or (`maxDepth` - `minDepth`) / 2 if
[VkPipelineViewportDepthClipControlCreateInfoEXT](#VkPipelineViewportDepthClipControlCreateInfoEXT)::`negativeOneToOne`
is `VK_TRUE`)

If a render pass transform is enabled, the values (px,py) and
(ox, oy) defining the viewport are transformed as described in
[render pass transform](#vertexpostproc-renderpass-transform) before
participating in the viewport transform.

The application **can** specify a negative term for `height`, which has the
effect of negating the y coordinate in clip space before performing the
transform.
When using a negative `height`, the application **should** also adjust the
`y` value to point to the lower left corner of the viewport instead of
the upper left corner.
Using the negative `height` allows the application to avoid having to
negate the y component of the `Position` output from the last
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization).

The width and height of the [implementation-dependent maximum viewport dimensions](limits.html#limits-maxViewportDimensions) **must** be greater than
or equal to the width and height of the largest image which **can** be created
and attached to a framebuffer.

The floating-point viewport bounds are represented with an
[implementation-dependent precision](limits.html#limits-viewportSubPixelBits).
