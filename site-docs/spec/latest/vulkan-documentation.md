## Content

[This site](https://docs.vulkan.org/) gathers together several key Vulkan
documents including specifications, extension proposals, guides, tutorials
and samples into a single site.
This allows searching and cross-linking across documents, to help navigate
quickly to the information you need for developing Vulkan-based
applications.

For more information about and resources for using the Vulkan graphics API,
see the Vulkan developer website at [https://vulkan.org](https://vulkan.org) .

This build of the site includes the Vulkan 1.4.316 API specification
(with all registered extensions), generated on 2025-06-02 17:46:13Z from git branch: main commit: dd1a021e15026b17c6f844cb42a59036b9f9a9b8.

The site is organized in “components” (Antora terminology for
specifications and other documents), each containing many “pages” (Antora
terminology for a chapter of a specification, or other distinct piece of
content for other components).

The left navigation sidebar links to pages in the current component.

The right navigation sidebar links to sections in the current page.

The bottom-left button switches between components.

The top navigation bar contains a text searchbox.
If the “In this component” box is checked, search will be restricted to
the current component.
Otherwise, all components of the site are searched.

[This site](https://docs.vulkan.org/) is generated using the
[Antora](https://docs.antora.org/) static site generator.
