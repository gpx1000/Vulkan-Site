When a pipeline is created, the set of shaders specified in the
corresponding `VkPipelineCreateInfo` structure are implicitly linked at
a number of different interfaces.

This chapter describes valid uses for a set of SPIR-V decorations.
Any other use of one of these decorations is invalid, with the exception
that, when using SPIR-V versions 1.4 and earlier: `Block`,
`BufferBlock`, `Offset`, `ArrayStride`, and `MatrixStride` can
also decorate types and type members used by variables in the `Private`
and `Function` storage classes.

|  | In this chapter, there are references to SPIR-V terms such as the
| --- | --- |
`MeshNV` execution model.
These terms will appear even in a build of the specification which does not
support any extensions.
This is as intended, since these terms appear in the unified SPIR-V
specification without such qualifiers. |

When multiple stages are present in a pipeline, the outputs of one stage
form an interface with the inputs of the next stage.
When such an interface involves a shader, shader outputs are matched against
the inputs of the next stage, and shader inputs are matched against the
outputs of the previous stage.

All the variables forming the shader input and output *interfaces* are
listed as operands to the `OpEntryPoint` instruction and are declared
with the `Input` or `Output` storage classes, respectively, in the
SPIR-V module.
These generally form the interfaces between consecutive shader stages,
regardless of any non-shader stages between the consecutive shader stages.

There are two classes of variables that **can** be matched between shader
stages, built-in variables and user-defined variables.
Each class has a different set of matching criteria.

`Output` variables of a shader stage have **undefined** values until the
shader writes to them or uses the `Initializer` operand when declaring
the variable.

For compute shaders, the input interface is formed by the built-in
interface.
The output interface is empty.

Shader [built-in](#interfaces-builtin-variables) variables meeting the
following requirements define the *built-in interface block*.
They **must**

* 
be explicitly declared (there are no implicit built-ins),

* 
be identified with a `BuiltIn` decoration,

* 
form object types as described in the
[Built-in Variables](#interfaces-builtin-variables) section, and

* 
be declared in a block whose top-level members are the built-ins.

There **must** be no more than one built-in interface block per shader per
interface
, except for the mesh output interface where there **must** be at most one
built-in interface block decorated with the `PerPrimitiveEXT` decoration
and at most one built-in interface block without this decoration
.

Built-ins **must** not have any `Location` or `Component` decorations.

The non-built-in variables listed by `OpEntryPoint` with the `Input`
or `Output` storage class form the *user-defined variable interface*.
These **must** have [numeric type](formats.html#formats-numericformat) or, recursively,
composite types of such types.
If an implementation supports [`storageInputOutput16`](features.html#features-storageInputOutput16), components **can** have a width of 16 bits.
These variables **must** be identified with a `Location` decoration and **can**
also be identified with a `Component` decoration.

An output variable, block, or structure member in a given shader stage has
an interface match with an input variable, block, or structure member in a
subsequent shader stage if they both adhere to the following conditions:

* 
They have equivalent decorations, other than:

`XfbBuffer`, `XfbStride`, `Offset`, and `Stream`

* 
one is not decorated with `Component` and the other is declared with
a `Component` of `0`

* 
[Interpolation decorations](shaders.html#shaders-interpolation-decorations)

* 
`RelaxedPrecision` if one is an input variable and the other an
output variable

Their types match as follows:

* 
if the input is declared in a tessellation control or geometry shader
as an `OpTypeArray` with an `Element` `Type` equivalent to the
`OpType*` declaration of the output, and neither is a structure
member; or

* 
if the [`maintenance4`](features.html#features-maintenance4) feature is
enabled, they are declared as `OpTypeVector` variables, and the
output has a `Component` `Count` value higher than that of the
input but the same `Component` `Type`; or

* 
if the output is declared in a mesh shader as an `OpTypeArray` with
an `Element` `Type` equivalent to the `OpType*` declaration of
the input, and neither is a structure member; or

* 
if the input is decorated with `PerVertexKHR`, and is declared in a
fragment shader as an `OpTypeArray` with an `Element` `Type`
equivalent to the `OpType*` declaration of the output, and neither
the input nor the output is a structure member; or

* 
if in any other case they are declared with an equivalent `OpType*`
declaration.

If both are structures and every member has an interface match.

|  | The word “structure” above refers to both variables that have an
| --- | --- |
`OpTypeStruct` type and interface blocks (which are also declared as
`OpTypeStruct`). |

If the pipeline is compiled as separate graphics pipeline libraries and the
[`graphicsPipelineLibraryIndependentInterpolationDecoration`](limits.html#limits-graphicsPipelineLibraryIndependentInterpolationDecoration) limit is
not supported, matches are not found if the
[interpolation decorations](shaders.html#shaders-interpolation-decorations) differ
between the last [pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) and the fragment shader stage.

All input variables and blocks **must** have an interface match in the
preceding shader stage, except for built-in variables in fragment shaders.
Shaders **can** declare and write to output variables that are not declared or
read by the subsequent stage.

Matching rules for *passthrough geometry shaders* are slightly different and
are described in the [Passthrough Interface Matching](geometry.html#geometry-passthrough-interface) section.

The value of an input variable is **undefined** if the preceding stage does not
write to a matching output variable, as described above.

[User-defined variables](#interfaces-iointerfaces-user) in interfaces
between shader stages in the graphics pipeline consume a unique set of
`Location` and `Component` values.

Available space for user-defined interface variables is partitioned into a
number of 32-bit four-component vectors, each identified by a `Location`
value.
Each individual 32-bit component of a vector is then further identified by a
`Component` value.

16-bit scalar or vector values consume one `Component` slot per 16-bit
component and **must** be specified within a single `Location`.
32-bit scalar or vector values consume one `Component` slot per 32-bit
component and **must** be specified within a single `Location`.
64-bit scalar or vector values consume two consecutive `Component` slots
per 64-bit component from up to two consecutive `Location` slots.

For any shader interface variable where [one level of the array is disregarded for type matching](#interfaces-iointerfaces-matching), the outer array
level is also disregarded when assigning `Location` slots.

An array of size n with elements consuming l `Location` slots
each will consume l × n `Location` slots.
Each element of the array will consume `Component` slots in each
`Location` slot identically to a declaration using the element type.

Matrices of size n × m are assigned locations identically to
arrays of size n of vectors of length 4 (consuming all `Component`
slots) with an identical element type.

When a variable with a structure type is decorated with a `Location`, the
members in the structure type **must** not be decorated with a `Location`.
The variable’s members are assigned consecutive locations in declaration
order, starting from the first member, which is assigned the location
decoration from the variable.
The `Location` slots consumed by structure members are determined by
applying the rules above in a depth-first traversal of the instantiated
members as though the structure or block member were declared as an input or
output variable of the same type.

A variable with a structure type that is not decorated with `Block` **must**
be decorated with a `Location`.

When a variable with a structure type decorated with `Block` is declared
without a `Location` decoration, each member in the structure **must** be
decorated with a `Location`.
Types nested deeper than the top-level members **must** not have `Location`
decorations.

Multiple variable declarations in the same storage class **must** not have
overlapping `Component` slots within the same `Location`.

The number of input and output locations available for a shader input or
output interface depend on the shader stage as described in
[Shader Input and Output Locations](#interfaces-iointerfaces-limits).
All variables in both the [built-in interface block](#interfaces-builtin-variables) and the [user-defined variable interface](#interfaces-iointerfaces-user) count against these limits.
Each effective `Location` **must** have a value less than the number of
`Location` slots available for the given interface, as specified in the
“Locations Available” column in [Shader Input and Output Locations](#interfaces-iointerfaces-limits).

| Shader Interface | Locations Available |
| --- | --- |
| vertex input | `maxVertexInputAttributes` |
| vertex output | `maxVertexOutputComponents` / 4 |
| tessellation control input | `maxTessellationControlPerVertexInputComponents` / 4 |
| tessellation control output | `maxTessellationControlPerVertexOutputComponents` / 4 |
| tessellation evaluation input | `maxTessellationEvaluationInputComponents` / 4 |
| tessellation evaluation output | `maxTessellationEvaluationOutputComponents` / 4 |
| geometry input | `maxGeometryInputComponents` / 4 |
| geometry output | `maxGeometryOutputComponents` / 4 |
| fragment input | `maxFragmentInputComponents` / 4 |
| fragment output | `maxFragmentOutputAttachments` |
| mesh output | `maxMeshOutputComponents` / 4 |
| cluster culling output | `maxOutputClusterCount` |

When the vertex stage is present in a pipeline, the vertex shader input
variables form an interface with the vertex input attributes.
The vertex shader input variables are matched by the `Location` and
`Component` decorations to the vertex input attributes specified in the
`pVertexInputState` member of the [VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo](pipelines.html#VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo)
structure.

The vertex shader input variables listed by `OpEntryPoint` with the
`Input` storage class form the *vertex input interface*.
These variables **must** be identified with a `Location` decoration and **can**
also be identified with a `Component` decoration.

For the purposes of interface matching: variables declared without a
`Component` decoration are considered to have a `Component` decoration
of zero.
The number of available vertex input `Location` slots is given by the
`maxVertexInputAttributes` member of the `VkPhysicalDeviceLimits`
structure.

See [Attribute Location and Component Assignment](fxvertex.html#fxvertex-attrib-location) for details.

All vertex shader inputs declared as above **must** have a corresponding
attribute and binding in the pipeline.

Components and locations are consumed as defined for
[Location and Component Assignment](#interfaces-iointerfaces-locations).
Multiple [user-defined input variable](#interfaces-iointerfaces-user)
declarations **must** not have overlapping `Component` slots within the same
`Location`.

When the fragment stage is present in a pipeline, the fragment shader
outputs form an interface with the output attachments defined by a
[render pass instance](renderpass.html#renderpass).
The fragment shader output variables are matched by the `Location` and
`Component` decorations to specified color attachments.

The fragment shader output variables listed by `OpEntryPoint` with the
`Output` storage class form the *fragment output interface*.
These variables **must** be identified with a `Location` decoration.
They **can** also be identified with a `Component` decoration and/or an
`Index` decoration.
For the purposes of interface matching: variables declared without a
`Component` decoration are considered to have a `Component` decoration
of zero, and variables declared without an `Index` decoration are
considered to have an `Index` decoration of zero.

A fragment shader output variable identified with a `Location` decoration
of *i* is associated with
the color attachment indicated by
[VkRenderingInfo](renderpass.html#VkRenderingInfo)::`pColorAttachments`[*i*].
When using render pass objects, it is associated with
the color attachment indicated by
[VkSubpassDescription](renderpass.html#VkSubpassDescription)::`pColorAttachments`[*i*].
Values are written to those attachments after passing through the blending
unit as described in [Blending](framebuffer.html#framebuffer-blending), if enabled.
The number of available fragment output `Location` slots is given by the
`maxFragmentOutputAttachments` member of the
`VkPhysicalDeviceLimits` structure.

If the
[`dynamicRenderingLocalRead`](features.html#features-dynamicRenderingLocalRead)
feature is supported, fragment output locations **can** be remapped when using
dynamic rendering.

To set the fragment output location mappings during rendering, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4
void vkCmdSetRenderingAttachmentLocations(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo*    pLocationInfo);

// Provided by VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read
// Equivalent to vkCmdSetRenderingAttachmentLocations
void vkCmdSetRenderingAttachmentLocationsKHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo*    pLocationInfo);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be
recorded.

* 
`pLocationInfo` is a [VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo](#VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo)
structure indicating the new mappings.

This command sets the attachment location mappings for subsequent drawing
commands, and **must** match the mappings provided to the bound pipeline,
if one is bound,
which **can** be set by chaining [VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo](#VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo) to
[VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo](pipelines.html#VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo).

Until this command is called, mappings in the command buffer state are
treated as each color attachment specified in [vkCmdBeginRendering](renderpass.html#vkCmdBeginRendering)
having a location equal to its index in
[VkRenderingInfo](renderpass.html#VkRenderingInfo)::`pColorAttachments`.
This state is reset whenever [vkCmdBeginRendering](renderpass.html#vkCmdBeginRendering) is called.

Conditional Rendering

vkCmdSetRenderingAttachmentLocations is not affected by [conditional rendering](drawing.html#drawing-conditional-rendering)

The `VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4
typedef struct VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    const void*        pNext;
    uint32_t           colorAttachmentCount;
    const uint32_t*    pColorAttachmentLocations;
} VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo;

// Provided by VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read
// Equivalent to VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo
typedef VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfoKHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`colorAttachmentCount` is the number of elements in
`pColorAttachmentLocations`.

* 
`pColorAttachmentLocations` is a pointer to an array of
`colorAttachmentCount` `uint32_t` values defining remapped
locations for color attachments.

This structure allows applications to remap the locations of color
attachments to different fragment shader output locations.

Each element of `pColorAttachmentLocations` set to
`VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED` will be inaccessible to this pipeline as a color
attachment; no location will map to it.
Each element of `pColorAttachmentLocations` set to any other value will
map the specified location value to the color attachment specified in the
render pass at the corresponding index in the
`pColorAttachmentLocations` array.
Any writes to a fragment output location that is not mapped to an attachment
**must** be discarded.

If `pColorAttachmentLocations` is `NULL`, it is equivalent to setting
each element to its index within the array.

This structure **can** be included in the `pNext` chain of a
[VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo](pipelines.html#VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo) structure to set this state for a
pipeline.
If this structure is not included in the `pNext` chain of
[VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo](pipelines.html#VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo), it is equivalent to specifying this
structure with the following properties:

* 
`colorAttachmentCount` set to
[VkPipelineRenderingCreateInfo](pipelines.html#VkPipelineRenderingCreateInfo)::`colorAttachmentCount`.

* 
`pColorAttachmentLocations` set to `NULL`.

This structure **can** be included in the `pNext` chain of a
[VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo) structure to specify inherited state
from the primary command buffer.
If [VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo)::renderPass is not
[VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE), or
`VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_RENDER_PASS_CONTINUE_BIT` is not specified in
[VkCommandBufferBeginInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkCommandBufferBeginInfo)::flags, members of this structure are
ignored.
If this structure is not included in the `pNext` chain of
[VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo), it is equivalent to specifying this
structure with the following properties:

* 
`colorAttachmentCount` set to
[VkCommandBufferInheritanceRenderingInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkCommandBufferInheritanceRenderingInfo)::`colorAttachmentCount`.

* 
`pColorAttachmentLocations` set to `NULL`.

Valid Usage

* 
[](#VUID-VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo-dynamicRenderingLocalRead-09512) VUID-VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo-dynamicRenderingLocalRead-09512

If the [    `dynamicRenderingLocalRead`](features.html#features-dynamicRenderingLocalRead) feature is not enabled, and
`pColorAttachmentLocations` is not `NULL`, each element **must** be the
value of its index within the array

* 
[](#VUID-VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo-pColorAttachmentLocations-09513) VUID-VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo-pColorAttachmentLocations-09513

Elements of `pColorAttachmentLocations` that are not
`VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED` **must** each be unique

* 
[](#VUID-VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo-colorAttachmentCount-09514) VUID-VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo-colorAttachmentCount-09514

`colorAttachmentCount` **must** be less than or equal to
[`maxColorAttachments`](limits.html#limits-maxColorAttachments)

* 
[](#VUID-VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo-pColorAttachmentLocations-09515) VUID-VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo-pColorAttachmentLocations-09515

Each element of `pColorAttachmentLocations` **must** be less than
[`maxColorAttachments`](limits.html#limits-maxColorAttachments)

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo-sType-sType) VUID-VkRenderingAttachmentLocationInfo-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_RENDERING_ATTACHMENT_LOCATION_INFO`

When an active fragment shader invocation finishes, the values of all
fragment shader outputs are copied out and used as blend inputs or color
attachments writes.
If the invocation does not set a value for them, the input values to those
blending or color attachment writes are **undefined**.
If there is no color attachment indicated by `Location`, the values that
would have been written to the color attachments are discarded.

Output `Component` words identified as 0, 1, 2, and 3 will be directed to
the R, G, B, and A inputs to the blending unit, respectively, or to the
output attachment if blending is disabled.
If two variables are placed within the same `Location`, they **must** have
the same underlying type (floating-point or integer).
`Component` words which do not correspond to any fragment shader output
will also result in **undefined** values for blending or color attachment
writes.

Fragment outputs identified with an `Index` of zero are directed to the
first input of the blending unit associated with the corresponding
`Location`.
Outputs identified with an `Index` of one are directed to the second
input of the corresponding blending unit.

Components and locations are consumed as defined for
[Location and Component Assignment](#interfaces-iointerfaces-locations).
Output variable declarations **must** not consume any of the same
`Component` slots within the same `Location` and with the same
`Index` value as any other output variable declaration.

Output values written by a fragment shader **must** be declared with either
`OpTypeFloat` or `OpTypeInt`, and a `Width` of 32.
If `storageInputOutput16` is supported, output values written by a
fragment shader **can** be also declared with either `OpTypeFloat` or
`OpTypeInt` and a `Width` of 16.
Composites of these types are also permitted.
If the color attachment has a signed or unsigned normalized fixed-point
format, color values are assumed to be floating-point and are converted to
fixed-point as described in [Conversion From Floating-Point to Normalized Fixed-Point](fundamentals.html#fundamentals-fpfixedconv); If the color
attachment has an integer format, color values are assumed to be integers
and converted to the bit-depth of the target.
Any value that cannot be represented in the attachment’s format is
**undefined**.
For any other attachment format no conversion is performed.
If the type of the values written by the fragment shader do not match the
format of the corresponding color attachment, the resulting values are
**undefined** for those components.

The application **can** enable dithering to be applied to the color output of a
subpass, by using the
`VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_ENABLE_LEGACY_DITHERING_BIT_EXT` flag.
For use in a dynamic render pass, the
`VK_RENDERING_ENABLE_LEGACY_DITHERING_BIT_EXT` flag **must** be used.
In that case, the pipelines used **must** have been created with
`VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_2_ENABLE_LEGACY_DITHERING_BIT_EXT`.

When dithering is enabled, the implementation **may** modify the output color
value c by one ULP.
This modification **must** only depend on the framebuffer coordinates
(xf,yf) of the sample, as well as on the value of c.

The exact details of the dithering algorithm are unspecified, including the
algorithm itself, the formats dithering is applied to, and the stage in
which it is applied.

|  | This extension is intended only for use by OpenGL emulation layers, and as
| --- | --- |
such the dithering algorithm applied to the subpass **should** be equivalent to
the vendor’s OpenGL implementation, if any. |

When a fragment stage is present in a pipeline, the fragment shader tile
image variables decorated with `Location` form an interface with the
color attachments defined by the render pass instance.
The fragment shader tile image variables are matched by `Location`
decorations to the color attachments specified in the
`pColorAttachments` array of the [VkRenderingInfoKHR](renderpass.html#VkRenderingInfoKHR) structure
describing the render pass instance the fragment shader is executed in.

The fragment shader variables listed by `OpEntryPoint` with the
`TileImageEXT` storage class and a decoration of `Location` form the
*fragment tile image interface*.
These variables **must** be declared with a type of `OpTypeImage`, and a
`Dim` operand of `TileImageDataEXT`.
The `Component` decoration is not supported for these variables.

Reading from a tile image variable with a `Location` decoration of *i*
reads from the color attachment identified by the element of
[VkRenderingInfoKHR](renderpass.html#VkRenderingInfoKHR)::`pColorAttachments` with a `location`
equal to *i*.
If the tile image variable is declared as an array of size N, it consumes N
consecutive tile image locations, starting with the index specified.
There **must** not be more than one tile image variable with the same
`Location` whether explicitly declared or implied by an array
declaration.
The number of available tile image locations is the same as the number of
available fragment output locations as given by the
`maxFragmentOutputAttachments` member of the
`VkPhysicalDeviceLimits` structure.

The basic data type (floating-point, integer, unsigned integer) of the tile
image variable **must** match the basic format of the corresponding color
attachment, or the values read from the tile image variables are **undefined**.

The image variables declared with `TileAttachmentQCOM` storage class form
the *tile attachment interface*.

These [tile attachment variables](renderpass.html#renderpass-tile-shading-attachment-access) correspond to a per-tile view of the color, depth, or input
attachment of the current subpass or render pass instance.

Such variables **must** only be declared and accessed in compute and fragment
shaders invoked within a render pass instance that
[enables tile shading](renderpass.html#renderpass-tile-shading).
Access of such variables in a fragment shader, additionally requires that
the [tileShadingFragmentStage](features.html#features-tileShadingFragmentStage) feature
**must** be enabled.

Tile attachment variables **must** not include a `Component` decoration.
Tile attachment variables **must** not be consumed by `OpImageQuery*`
instructions.
Tile attachment variables **can** be declared as either single-sampled with
`MS` operand of `0`, or as multi-sampled with `MS` operand of `1`.
The image subresources of the tile attachment image **must** not be in
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED`
or `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT`
layout in order to access its data in a shader.

Tile attachment variables statically accessed by a fragment or compute
shader **must** be backed by a descriptor that is equivalent to the
[VkImageView](resources.html#VkImageView) in the [VkFramebuffer](renderpass.html#VkFramebuffer)
or the [VkRenderingAttachmentInfo](renderpass.html#VkRenderingAttachmentInfo)
except for `subresourceRange.aspectMask`.
The `aspectMask` **must** be equal to the aspect accessed by the shader.

*Tile attachment variables* are further subdivided into *storage tile
attachment*, *sampled tile attachment*, and *input tile attachment*
variables.

* 
*Sampled tile attachment* variables **must** be declared with a
`Sampled` operand of `1`, **must** be backed by a descriptor of type
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLED_IMAGE`,
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_BLOCK_MATCH_IMAGE_QCOM`,
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_IMAGE_QCOM`,
or `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER`, and **can** be used
with `OpImageFetch`, `OpImageSparseFetch`, or used to construct an
`OpTypeSampledImage` that is subsequently consumed by
`OpImageSample*`, `OpImageSparseSample*`,
`OpImageSampleWeightedQCOM`, `OpImageBoxFilterQCOM`,
`OpImageBlockMatch*QCOM`,
`OpImage*Gather`, or `OpImageSparse*Gather`.
*Sampled tile attachment* variables are managed by the
[Descriptor Set Interface](#interfaces-resources-descset) as sampled
images.

* 
*Storage tile attachment* variables **must** be declared with a
`Sampled` operand of `2`, **must** be backed by a descriptor of type
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_IMAGE`, and **can** be used with
`OpImageRead`, `OpImageSparseRead`, and `OpImageWrite`
instructions.
*Storage tile attachment* variables **can** be consumed by
`OpImageTexelPointer` for compatibility with atomic operations.
*Sampled tile attachment* variables are managed by the
[Descriptor Set Interface](#interfaces-resources-descset) as storage
images.

* 
*Input tile attachment* variables **must** be declared with a `Sampled`
operand of `2`, **must** be backed by a descriptor of type
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT`, and **can** be used with
`OpImageRead` instructions.
*Input tile attachment* variables are managed by the
[Descriptor Set Interface](#interfaces-resources-descset) as input
attachment images.

Tile attachment access using `OpImageWrite` instructions **must** be used
only in the compute stage.
Tile attachment access using `OpImageWrite` instructions **must** not be
used on a variable whose underlying descriptor references the same
[VkImageView](resources.html#VkImageView) bound as a depth or stencil attachment.

The basic data type (floating-point, integer, unsigned integer) of the tile
attachment variable **must** match the basic format of the corresponding input,
depth, or color attachment, otherwise the result of loads/stores for tile
attachment variables is **undefined**.
If the render pass attachment contains both depth and stencil aspects, the
basic data type of the tile attachment variable determines if depth or
stencil aspect is accessed by the shader.

When a fragment stage is present in a pipeline, the fragment shader subpass
inputs form an interface with the input attachments of the current subpass.
The fragment shader subpass input variables are matched by
`InputAttachmentIndex` decorations to the input attachments specified in
the `pInputAttachments` array of the [VkSubpassDescription](renderpass.html#VkSubpassDescription)
structure describing the subpass that the fragment shader is executed in.

The fragment shader subpass input variables with the `UniformConstant`
storage class and a decoration of `InputAttachmentIndex` that are
statically used by `OpEntryPoint` form the *fragment input attachment
interface*.
These variables **must** be declared with a type of `OpTypeImage`, a
`Dim` operand of `SubpassData`, an `Arrayed` operand of 0, and a
`Sampled` operand of 2.
The `MS` operand of the `OpTypeImage` **must** be 0 if the `samples`
field of the corresponding [VkAttachmentDescription](renderpass.html#VkAttachmentDescription) is
`VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT` and
[multisampled-render-to-single-sampled](renderpass.html#subpass-multisampledrendertosinglesampled)
is not enabled, and
1 otherwise.

A subpass input variable identified with an `InputAttachmentIndex`
decoration of *i* reads from the input attachment indicated by
`pInputAttachments`[*i*] member of `VkSubpassDescription`.
If the subpass input variable is declared as an array of size N, it consumes
N consecutive input attachments, starting with the index specified.
There **must** not be more than one input variable with the same
`InputAttachmentIndex` whether explicitly declared or implied by an array
declaration per image aspect.
A multi-aspect image (e.g. a depth/stencil format) **can** use the same input
variable.
The number of available input attachment indices is given by the
`maxPerStageDescriptorInputAttachments` member of the
`VkPhysicalDeviceLimits` structure.

When using dynamic rendering with the [`dynamicRenderingLocalRead`](features.html#features-dynamicRenderingLocalRead) feature enabled, a subpass input variable
with a `InputAttachmentIndex` decoration of *i* can be mapped to a color,
depth, or stencil attachment.

To set the input attachment index mappings during dynamic rendering, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4
void vkCmdSetRenderingInputAttachmentIndices(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkRenderingInputAttachmentIndexInfo*  pInputAttachmentIndexInfo);

// Provided by VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read
// Equivalent to vkCmdSetRenderingInputAttachmentIndices
void vkCmdSetRenderingInputAttachmentIndicesKHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkRenderingInputAttachmentIndexInfo*  pInputAttachmentIndexInfo);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be
recorded.

* 
`pInputAttachmentIndexInfo` is a
[VkRenderingInputAttachmentIndexInfo](#VkRenderingInputAttachmentIndexInfo) structure indicating the new
mappings.

This command sets the input attachment index mappings for subsequent drawing
commands, and **must** match the mappings provided to the bound pipeline,
if one is bound,
which **can** be set by chaining [VkRenderingInputAttachmentIndexInfo](#VkRenderingInputAttachmentIndexInfo) to
[VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo](pipelines.html#VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo).

Until this command is called, mappings in the command buffer state are
treated as each color attachment specified in [vkCmdBeginRendering](renderpass.html#vkCmdBeginRendering)
mapping to subpass inputs with a `InputAttachmentIndex` equal to its
index in [VkRenderingInfo](renderpass.html#VkRenderingInfo)::`pColorAttachments`, and depth/stencil
attachments mapping to input attachments without these decorations.
This state is reset whenever [vkCmdBeginRendering](renderpass.html#vkCmdBeginRendering) is called.

Conditional Rendering

vkCmdSetRenderingInputAttachmentIndices is not affected by [conditional rendering](drawing.html#drawing-conditional-rendering)

The `VkRenderingInputAttachmentIndexInfo` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4
typedef struct VkRenderingInputAttachmentIndexInfo {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    const void*        pNext;
    uint32_t           colorAttachmentCount;
    const uint32_t*    pColorAttachmentInputIndices;
    const uint32_t*    pDepthInputAttachmentIndex;
    const uint32_t*    pStencilInputAttachmentIndex;
} VkRenderingInputAttachmentIndexInfo;

// Provided by VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read
// Equivalent to VkRenderingInputAttachmentIndexInfo
typedef VkRenderingInputAttachmentIndexInfo VkRenderingInputAttachmentIndexInfoKHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`colorAttachmentCount` is the number of elements in
`pColorAttachmentInputIndices`.

* 
`pColorAttachmentInputIndices` is a pointer to an array of
`colorAttachmentCount` `uint32_t` values defining indices for
color attachments to be used as input attachments.

* 
`pDepthInputAttachmentIndex` is either `NULL`, or a pointer to a
`uint32_t` value defining the index for the depth attachment to be
used as an input attachment.

* 
`pStencilInputAttachmentIndex` is either `NULL`, or a pointer to a
`uint32_t` value defining the index for the stencil attachment to be
used as an input attachment.

This structure allows applications to remap attachments to different input
attachment indices.

Each element of `pColorAttachmentInputIndices` set to a value of
`VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED` indicates that the corresponding attachment will
not be used as an input attachment in this pipeline.
Any other value in each of those elements will map the corresponding
attachment to a `InputAttachmentIndex` value defined in shader code.

If `pColorAttachmentInputIndices` is `NULL`, it is equivalent to setting
each element to its index within the array.

If `pDepthInputAttachmentIndex` or `pStencilInputAttachmentIndex`
are set to `NULL`, they map to input attachments without a
`InputAttachmentIndex` decoration.
If they point to a value of `VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED`, it indicates that
the corresponding attachment will not be used as an input attachment in this
pipeline.
If they point to any other value it maps the corresponding attachment to a
`InputAttachmentIndex` value defined in shader code.

This structure **can** be included in the `pNext` chain of a
[VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo](pipelines.html#VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo) structure to set this state for a
pipeline.
If this structure is not included in the `pNext` chain of
[VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo](pipelines.html#VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo), it is equivalent to specifying this
structure with the following properties:

* 
`colorAttachmentCount` set to
[VkPipelineRenderingCreateInfo](pipelines.html#VkPipelineRenderingCreateInfo)::`colorAttachmentCount`.

* 
`pColorAttachmentInputIndices` set to `NULL`.

* 
`pDepthInputAttachmentIndex` set to `NULL`.

* 
`pStencilInputAttachmentIndex` set to `NULL`.

This structure **can** be included in the `pNext` chain of a
[VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo) structure to specify inherited state
from the primary command buffer.
If this structure is not included in the `pNext` chain of
[VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo), it is equivalent to specifying this
structure with the following properties:

* 
`colorAttachmentCount` set to

* 
`pColorAttachmentInputIndices` set to `NULL`.

 If `pStencilInputAttachmentIndex` is not `NULL`, `pStencilInputAttachmentIndex` **must** be a valid pointer to a valid `uint32_t` value

Variables identified with the `InputAttachmentIndex` **must** only be used
by a fragment stage.
The [numeric format](formats.html#formats-numericformat) of the subpass input **must**
match the format of the corresponding input attachment, or the values of
subpass loads from these variables are **undefined**.
If the framebuffer attachment contains both depth and stencil aspects, the
numeric format of the subpass input determines if depth or stencil aspect is
accessed by the shader.

See [Input Attachment](descriptorsets.html#descriptorsets-inputattachment) for more details.

An input attachment that is statically accessed by a fragment shader **must**
be backed by a descriptor that is equivalent to the [VkImageView](resources.html#VkImageView) in the
[VkFramebuffer](renderpass.html#VkFramebuffer), except for `subresourceRange.aspectMask`.
The `aspectMask` **must** be equal to the aspect accessed by the shader.

Ray tracing pipelines **may** have more stages than other pipelines with
multiple instances of each stage and more dynamic interactions between the
stages, but still have interface structures that obey the same general rules
as interfaces between shader stages in other pipelines.
The three types of inter-stage interface variables for ray tracing pipelines
are:

* 
Ray payloads containing data preserved for the entire lifetime of the
ray.

* 
Hit attributes containing data about a specific hit for the duration of
its processing.

* 
Callable data for passing data into and out of a callable shader.

Ray payloads and callable data are used in explicit shader call
instructions, so they have an incoming variant to distinguish the parameter
passed to the invocation from any other payloads or data being used by
subsequent shader call instructions.

An interface structure between stages **must** match between the stages using
it.
Specifically:

* 
If an intersection shader is present, the hit attribute structure read
in an any-hit or closest hit shader **must** be the same structure as the
hit attribute structure written in the corresponding intersection shader
in the same hit group.

* 
If an intersection shader is not present, the hit attribute structure
read in an any-hit or closest hit shader **must** be a vector of 2 32-bit
floating-point values that accepts the barycentric coordinates for
triangle hits.

* 
The incoming callable data for a callable shader **must** be the same
structure as the callable data referenced by the execute callable
instruction in the calling shader.

* 
The ray payload for a shader invoked by a ray tracing command **must** be
the same structure for all shader stages using the payload for that ray,
and **must** be declared in the shader even if it is not referenced.

Any shader with an incoming ray payload, incoming callable data, or hit
attribute **must** only declare one variable of that type.

| Shader Stage | Ray Payload | Incoming Ray Payload | Hit Attribute | Callable Data | Incoming Callable Data |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ray Generation | r/w |  |  | r/w |  |
| Intersection |  |  | r/w |  |  |
| Any-Hit |  | r/w | r |  |  |
| Closest Hit | r/w | r/w | r | r/w |  |
| Miss | r/w | r/w |  | r/w |  |
| Callable |  |  |  | r/w | r/w |

When a shader stage accesses
buffer, tensor,
or image resources, as described in the [Resource Descriptors](descriptorsets.html#descriptorsets) section, the shader resource variables **must** be matched with
the [pipeline layout](descriptorsets.html#descriptorsets-pipelinelayout) that is provided at
pipeline creation time.

The set of shader variables that form the *shader resource interface* for a
stage are the variables statically used by that stage’s `OpEntryPoint`
with a storage class of `Uniform`, `UniformConstant`,
`StorageBuffer`,
or `PushConstant`.
For the fragment shader, this includes the [fragment input attachment interface](#interfaces-inputattachment).

The shader resource interface consists of two sub-interfaces: the push
constant interface and the descriptor set interface.

The shader variables defined with a storage class of `PushConstant` that
are statically used by the shader entry points for the pipeline define the
*push constant interface*.
They **must** be:

* 
typed as `OpTypeStruct`,

* 
identified with a `Block` decoration, and

* 
laid out explicitly using the `Offset`, `ArrayStride`, and
`MatrixStride` decorations as specified in
[Offset and Stride Assignment](#interfaces-resources-layout).

There **must** be no more than one push constant block statically used per
shader entry point.

Each statically used member of a push constant block **must** be placed at an
`Offset` such that the entire member is entirely contained within the
[VkPushConstantRange](descriptorsets.html#VkPushConstantRange) for each `OpEntryPoint` that uses it, and the
`stageFlags` for that range **must** specify the appropriate
[VkShaderStageFlagBits](pipelines.html#VkShaderStageFlagBits) for that stage.
The `Offset` decoration for any member of a push constant block **must** not
cause the space required for that member to extend outside the range
[0, `maxPushConstantsSize`).

Any member of a push constant block that is declared as an array **must** only
be accessed with *dynamically uniform* indices.

The *descriptor set interface* is comprised of the shader variables with the
storage class of
`StorageBuffer`,
`TileAttachmentQCOM`,
`Uniform` or `UniformConstant` (including the variables in the
[fragment input attachment interface](#interfaces-inputattachment)) that are
statically used by the shader entry points for the pipeline.

These variables **must** have `DescriptorSet` and `Binding` decorations
specified, which are assigned and matched with the
`VkDescriptorSetLayout` objects in the pipeline layout as described in
[DescriptorSet and Binding Assignment](#interfaces-resources-setandbinding).

The `Image` `Format` of an `OpTypeImage` declaration **must** not be
**Unknown**, for variables which are used for `OpImageRead`,
`OpImageSparseRead`, or `OpImageWrite` operations, except under the
following conditions:

* 
For `OpImageWrite`, if the image format is listed in the
[storage without format](formats.html#formats-without-shader-storage-format) list
and if the [    `shaderStorageImageWriteWithoutFormat`](features.html#features-shaderStorageImageWriteWithoutFormat) feature is enabled and the
shader module declares the `StorageImageWriteWithoutFormat`
capability.

* 
For `OpImageWrite`, if the image format supports
`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_2_STORAGE_WRITE_WITHOUT_FORMAT_BIT` and the
shader module declares the `StorageImageWriteWithoutFormat`
capability.

* 
For `OpImageRead` or `OpImageSparseRead`, if the image format is
listed in the [storage without    format](formats.html#formats-without-shader-storage-format) list and if the [    `shaderStorageImageReadWithoutFormat`](features.html#features-shaderStorageImageReadWithoutFormat) feature is enabled and the
shader module declares the `StorageImageReadWithoutFormat`
capability.

* 
For `OpImageRead` or `OpImageSparseRead`, if the image format
supports `VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_2_STORAGE_READ_WITHOUT_FORMAT_BIT` and
the shader module declares the `StorageImageReadWithoutFormat`
capability.

* 
For `OpImageRead`, if `Dim` is `SubpassData` (indicating a read
from an input attachment).

The `Image` `Format` of an `OpTypeImage` declaration **must** not be
**Unknown**, for variables which are used for `OpAtomic*` operations.

Variables identified with the `Uniform` storage class are used to access
transparent buffer backed resources.
Such variables **must** be:

* 
typed as `OpTypeStruct`, or an array of this type,

* 
identified with a `Block` or `BufferBlock` decoration, and

* 
laid out explicitly using the `Offset`, `ArrayStride`, and
`MatrixStride` decorations as specified in
[Offset and Stride Assignment](#interfaces-resources-layout).

Variables identified with the `StorageBuffer` storage class are used to
access transparent buffer backed resources.
Such variables **must** be:

* 
typed as `OpTypeStruct`, or an array of this type,

* 
identified with a `Block` decoration, and

* 
laid out explicitly using the `Offset`, `ArrayStride`, and
`MatrixStride` decorations as specified in
[Offset and Stride Assignment](#interfaces-resources-layout).

The `Offset` decoration for any member of a `Block`-decorated variable
in the `Uniform` storage class **must** not cause the space required for
that variable to extend outside the range [0,
`maxUniformBufferRange`).
The `Offset` decoration for any member of a `Block`-decorated variable
in the `StorageBuffer` storage class **must** not cause the space required
for that variable to extend outside the range [0,
`maxStorageBufferRange`).

Variables identified with the `Uniform` storage class **can** also be used
to access transparent descriptor set backed resources when the variable is
assigned to a descriptor set layout binding with a `descriptorType` of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK`.
In this case the variable **must** be typed as `OpTypeStruct` and **cannot** be
aggregated into arrays of that type.
Further, the `Offset` decoration for any member of such a variable **must**
not cause the space required for that variable to extend outside the range
[0,`maxInlineUniformBlockSize`).

*Storage tile attachment* and *sampled tile attachment* variables declared
as described in the [tile attachment interface](renderpass.html#renderpass-tile-shading-attachment-access) are also managed by this interface.
The requirements in this section for storage image variables also applies to
*storage tile attachment* variables.
The requirements in this section for sampled image variables also applies to
*sampled tile attachment* variables.
The requirements in this section for input attachment variables also applies
to *input tile attachment* variables.

Variables identified with a storage class of `UniformConstant` and a
decoration of `InputAttachmentIndex` **must** be declared as described in
[Fragment Input Attachment Interface](#interfaces-inputattachment).

SPIR-V variables decorated with a descriptor set and binding that identify a
[combined image sampler descriptor](descriptorsets.html#descriptorsets-combinedimagesampler)
**can** have a type of `OpTypeImage`, `OpTypeSampler` (`Sampled`=1),
or `OpTypeSampledImage`.

When accessing a resource through such a variable, the resource **must** be
selected via compile time constant expressions unless features are enabled
to allow dynamically uniform or non-uniform expressions, as described below:

|  | Implementations must take care when implementing this if subgroups are not
| --- | --- |
necessarily a subset of the invocation group for their hardware (e.g. if
multiple draw calls are packed together).
If such an implementation needs uniformity across the subgroup for any
resource access, the implementation is responsible for ensuring that indices
that are only dynamically uniform across the invocation group still function
as expected if they advertise the respective feature. |

Where `OpTypeImage` is referenced, the `Dim` values `Buffer`
and `Subpassdata` are only accepted where they are specifically
referenced.
They do not correspond to resource types where a generic
`OpTypeImage` is specified.

2

In addition to `DescriptorSet` and `Binding`.

A variable decorated with a `DescriptorSet` decoration of s and a
`Binding` decoration of b indicates that this variable is
associated with the [VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding](descriptorsets.html#VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding) that has a
`binding` equal to b in `pSetLayouts`[*s*] that was specified
in [VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo](descriptorsets.html#VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo).

`DescriptorSet` decoration values **must** be between zero and
`maxBoundDescriptorSets` minus one, inclusive.
`Binding` decoration values **can** be any 32-bit unsigned integer value, as
described in [Descriptor Set Layout](descriptorsets.html#descriptorsets-setlayout).
Each descriptor set has its own binding name space.

If the `Binding` decoration is used with an array, the entire array is
assigned that binding value.
The decorated array **must** have an `Element` `Type` corresponding to a
descriptor type, and the size of the array **must** be no larger than the
number of descriptors in the binding.
If the array is runtime-sized, then array elements greater than or equal to
the size of that binding in the bound descriptor set **must** not be used.
If the array is runtime-sized, the [`runtimeDescriptorArray`](features.html#features-runtimeDescriptorArray) feature **must** be enabled and the
`RuntimeDescriptorArray` capability **must** be declared.
The index of each element of the array is referred to as the *arrayElement*.
For the purposes of interface matching and descriptor set
[operations](descriptorsets.html#descriptorsets-updates), if a resource variable is not an
array, it is treated as if it has an arrayElement of zero.

There is a limit on the number of resources of each type that **can** be
accessed by a pipeline stage as shown in
[Shader Resource Limits](#interfaces-resources-limits).
The “Resources Per Stage” column gives the limit on the number each type
of resource that **can** be statically used for an entry point in any given
stage in a pipeline.
The “Resource Types” column lists which resource types are counted against
the limit.
Some resource types count against multiple limits.
The `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT` descriptor type counts as one
individual resource and one for every unique resource limit per descriptor
set type that is present in the associated binding’s
[VkMutableDescriptorTypeListEXT](descriptorsets.html#VkMutableDescriptorTypeListEXT).
If multiple descriptor types in [VkMutableDescriptorTypeListEXT](descriptorsets.html#VkMutableDescriptorTypeListEXT) map to
the same resource limit, only one descriptor is consumed for purposes of
computing resource limits.

The pipeline layout **may** include descriptor sets and bindings which are not
referenced by any variables statically used by the entry points for the
shader stages in the binding’s `stageFlags`.

However, if a variable assigned to a given `DescriptorSet` and
`Binding` is statically used by the entry point for a shader stage, the
pipeline layout **must** contain a descriptor set layout binding in that
descriptor set layout and for that binding number, and that binding’s
`stageFlags` **must** include the appropriate [VkShaderStageFlagBits](pipelines.html#VkShaderStageFlagBits)
for that stage.
The variable **must** be of a valid resource type determined by its SPIR-V type
and storage class, as defined in
[Shader Resource and Storage Class Correspondence](#interfaces-resources-storage-class-correspondence).
The descriptor set layout binding **must** be of a corresponding descriptor
type, as defined in [Shader Resource and Descriptor Type Correspondence](#interfaces-resources-correspondence).

|  | There are no limits on the number of shader variables that can have
| --- | --- |
overlapping set and binding values in a shader; but which resources are
[statically used](shaders.html#shaders-staticuse) has an impact.
If any shader variable identifying a resource is
[statically used](shaders.html#shaders-staticuse) in a shader, then the underlying
descriptor bound at the declared set and binding **must**
[support the declared type in the shader](#interfaces-resources-correspondence) when the shader executes.

If multiple shader variables are declared with the same set and binding
values, and with the same underlying descriptor type, they can all be
statically used within the same shader.
However, accesses are not automatically synchronized, and `Aliased`
decorations should be used to avoid data hazards (see
[section
2.18.2 Aliasing in the SPIR-V specification](https://registry.khronos.org/spir-v/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#_a_id_aliasingsection_a_aliasing)).

If multiple shader variables with the same set and binding values are
declared in a single shader, but with different declared types, where any of
those are not supported by the relevant bound descriptor, that shader can
only be executed if the variables with the unsupported type are not
statically used.

A noteworthy example of using multiple statically-used shader variables
sharing the same descriptor set and binding values is a descriptor of type
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER` that has multiple
corresponding shader variables in the `UniformConstant` storage class,
where some could be `OpTypeImage` (`Sampled`=1), some could be
`OpTypeSampler`, and some could be `OpTypeSampledImage`. |

Input attachments **can** only be used in the fragment shader stage

When a SPIR-V object is declared using an
[explicit
layout](https://registry.khronos.org/spir-v/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#ExplicitLayout), it **must** be laid out according to the following additional
requirements.

|  | The numeric order of `Offset` decorations does not need to follow member
| --- | --- |
declaration order. |

**Alignment Requirements**

There are different alignment requirements depending on the specific
resources and on the features enabled.

Matrix types are defined in terms of arrays as follows:

* 
A column-major matrix with C columns and R rows is
equivalent to a C element array of vectors with R
components.

* 
A row-major matrix with C columns and R rows is equivalent
to an R element array of vectors with C components.

The *scalar alignment* of the type of an `OpTypeStruct` member is defined
recursively as follows:

* 
A scalar of size N has a scalar alignment of N.

* 
A vector type has a scalar alignment equal to that of its component
type.

* 
An array type has a scalar alignment equal to that of its element type.

* 
A structure has a scalar alignment equal to the largest scalar alignment
of any of its members.

* 
A matrix type inherits *scalar alignment* from the equivalent array
declaration.

The *base alignment* of the type of an `OpTypeStruct` member is defined
recursively as follows:

* 
A scalar has a base alignment equal to its scalar alignment.

* 
A two-component vector has a base alignment equal to twice its scalar
alignment.

* 
A three- or four-component vector has a base alignment equal to four
times its scalar alignment.

* 
An array has a base alignment equal to the base alignment of its element
type.

* 
A structure has a base alignment equal to the largest base alignment of
any of its members.
An empty structure has a base alignment equal to the size of the
smallest scalar type permitted by the capabilities declared in the
SPIR-V module.
(e.g., for a 1 byte aligned empty structure in the `StorageBuffer`
storage class, `StorageBuffer8BitAccess` or
`UniformAndStorageBuffer8BitAccess` **must** be declared in the SPIR-V
module.)

* 
A matrix type inherits *base alignment* from the equivalent array
declaration.

The *extended alignment* of the type of an `OpTypeStruct` member is
similarly defined as follows:

* 
A scalar or vector type has an extended alignment equal to its base
alignment.

* 
An array or structure type has an extended alignment equal to the
largest extended alignment of any of its members, rounded up to a
multiple of 16.

* 
A matrix type inherits extended alignment from the equivalent array
declaration.

A member is defined to *improperly straddle* if either of the following are
true:

* 
It is a vector with total size less than or equal to 16 bytes, and has
`Offset` decorations placing its first byte at F and its last
byte at L, where floor(F / 16) != floor(L / 16).

* 
It is a vector with total size greater than 16 bytes and has its
`Offset` decorations placing its first byte at a non-integer multiple
of 16.

**Standard Buffer Layout**

Every member of an `OpTypeStruct` that is required to be explicitly laid
out **must** be aligned according to the first matching rule as follows.
If the structure is contained in pointer types of multiple storage classes,
it **must** satisfy the requirements for every storage class used to reference
it.

If the [`scalarBlockLayout`](features.html#features-scalarBlockLayout) feature
is enabled and the storage class is `Uniform`, `StorageBuffer`,
`PhysicalStorageBuffer`,
`ShaderRecordBufferKHR`,
or `PushConstant` then every member **must** be aligned according to its
scalar alignment.

If the [    `workgroupMemoryExplicitLayoutScalarBlockLayout`](features.html#features-workgroupMemoryExplicitLayoutScalarBlockLayout) feature is
enabled and the storage class is `Workgroup` then every member **must**
be aligned according to its scalar alignment.

All vectors **must** be aligned according to their scalar alignment.

If the [    `uniformBufferStandardLayout`](features.html#features-uniformBufferStandardLayout) feature is not enabled, then any
member of an `OpTypeStruct` with a storage class of `Uniform` and
a decoration of `Block` **must** be aligned according to its extended
alignment.

Every other member **must** be aligned according to its base alignment.

|  | Even if scalar alignment is supported, it is generally more performant to
| --- | --- |
use the *base alignment*. |

The memory layout **must** obey the following rules:

* 
The `Offset` decoration of any member **must** be a multiple of its
alignment.

* 
Any `ArrayStride` or `MatrixStride` decoration **must** be a multiple
of the alignment of the array or matrix as defined above.

If one of the conditions below applies

* 
The storage class is `Uniform`, `StorageBuffer`,
`PhysicalStorageBuffer`,
`ShaderRecordBufferKHR`,
or `PushConstant`, and the [    `scalarBlockLayout`](features.html#features-scalarBlockLayout) feature is not enabled.

* 
The storage class is `Workgroup`, and either the structure member is
not part of a `Block` or the
[    `workgroupMemoryExplicitLayoutScalarBlockLayout`](features.html#features-workgroupMemoryExplicitLayoutScalarBlockLayout) feature is not
enabled.

* 
The storage class is any other storage class.

the memory layout **must** also obey the following rules:

* 
Vectors **must** not improperly straddle, as defined above.

* 
The `Offset` decoration of a member **must** not place it between the
end of a structure, an array or a matrix and the next multiple of the
alignment of that structure, array or matrix.

|  | The **std430 layout** in GLSL satisfies these rules for types using the base
| --- | --- |
alignment.
The **std140 layout** satisfies the rules for types using the extended
alignment. |

Built-in variables are accessed in shaders by declaring a variable decorated
with a `BuiltIn` SPIR-V decoration.
The meaning of each `BuiltIn` decoration is as follows.
In the remainder of this section, the name of a built-in is used
interchangeably with a term equivalent to a variable decorated with that
particular built-in.
Built-ins that represent integer values **can** be declared as either signed or
unsigned 32-bit integers.

[As mentioned above](#interfaces-iointerfaces-matching), some inputs and
outputs have an additional level of arrayness relative to other shader
inputs and outputs.
This level of arrayness is not included in the type descriptions below, but
**must** be included when declaring the built-in.

Any two variables declared in the `Input` storage class listed as
operands on the same `OpEntryPoint` **must** not have the same `BuiltIn`
decoration.
Any two variables declared in the `Output` storage class listed as
operands on the same `OpEntryPoint` **must** not have the same `BuiltIn`
decoration.

means the vertex is inside the clip half-space, and a negative distance
means the vertex is outside the clip half-space.

|  | The array variable decorated with `ClipDistance` is explicitly sized by
| --- | --- |
the shader. |

|  | In the last [pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization), these values will be linearly interpolated across the
| --- | --- |
primitive and the portion of the primitive with interpolated distances less
than 0 will be considered outside the clip volume.
If `ClipDistance` is then used by a fragment shader, `ClipDistance`
contains these linearly interpolated values. |

`Layer`

Decorating a variable with the `Layer` built-in decoration will make that
variable contain the select layer of a multi-layer framebuffer attachment.

In a
mesh,
vertex, tessellation evaluation, or
geometry shader, any variable decorated with `Layer` can be written with
the framebuffer layer index to which the primitive produced by that shader
will be directed.

The last active
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) (in pipeline order) controls the `Layer` that is used.
Outputs in previous shader stages are not used, even if the last stage fails
to write the `Layer`.

If the last active
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) shader entry point’s interface does not include a variable decorated
with `Layer`, then the first layer is used.
If a [pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) shader entry point’s interface includes a variable decorated with
`Layer`, it **must** write the same value to `Layer` for all output
vertices of a given primitive.
If the `Layer` value is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the
number of layers in the framebuffer, then primitives **may** still be
rasterized, fragment shaders **may** be executed, and the framebuffer values
for all layers are **undefined**.
In a mesh shader this also applies when the `Layer` value is greater than
or equal to the `maxMeshOutputLayers` limit.

If a variable with the `Layer` decoration is also decorated with
`ViewportRelativeNV`, then the `ViewportIndex` is added to the layer
that is used for rendering and that is made available in the fragment
shader.

If the shader writes to a variable decorated `ViewportMaskNV`, then the
layer selected has a different value for each viewport a primitive is
rendered to.

In a fragment shader, a variable decorated with `Layer` contains the
layer index of the primitive that the fragment invocation belongs to.

`VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance5Properties`::`polygonModePointSize` is
set to `VK_TRUE`
.
The value written to the variable decorated with `PointSize` by the last
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) in the pipeline is used as the framebuffer-space size of points
produced by rasterization.
If the [`maintenance5`](features.html#features-maintenance5) feature is enabled and
a value is not written to a variable decorated with `PointSize`, a value
of 1.0 is used as the size of points.

|  | When `PointSize` decorates a variable in the `Input` `Storage` `Class`,

that variable contain the position of the current vertex.

used in subsequent primitive assembly, clipping, and rasterization
operations.

`PositionPerViewNV`

Decorating a variable with the `PositionPerViewNV` built-in decoration
will make that variable contain the position of the current vertex, for each
view.

Elements of the array correspond to views in a multiview subpass, and those
elements corresponding to views in the view mask of the subpass the shader
is compiled against will be used as the position value for those views.
For the final
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) in the pipeline, values written to an output variable decorated with
`PositionPerViewNV` are used in subsequent primitive assembly, clipping,
and rasterization operations, as with `Position`.
`PositionPerViewNV` output in an earlier
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) is available as an input in the subsequent
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization).

If a shader is compiled against a subpass that has the
`VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_PER_VIEW_POSITION_X_ONLY_BIT_NVX` bit set, then
the position values for each view **must** not differ in any component other
than the X component.
If the values do differ, one will be chosen in an implementation-dependent
manner.

The variable decorated with `PrimitiveCountNV` **must** be declared as a
scalar 32-bit integer value

`PrimitiveId`

Decorating a variable with the `PrimitiveId` built-in decoration will
make that variable contain the index of the current primitive.

The index of the first primitive generated by a drawing command is zero, and
the index is incremented after every individual point, line, or triangle
primitive is processed.

For triangles drawn as points or line segments (see [Polygon Mode](primsrast.html#primsrast-polygonmode)), the primitive index is incremented only once, even if
multiple points or lines are eventually drawn.

Variables decorated with `PrimitiveId` are reset to zero between each
instance drawn.

Restarting a primitive topology using primitive restart has no effect on the
value of variables decorated with `PrimitiveId`.

In tessellation control and tessellation evaluation shaders, it will contain
the index of the patch within the current set of rendering primitives that
corresponds to the shader invocation.

In a geometry shader, it will contain the number of primitives presented as
input to the shader since the current set of rendering primitives was
started.

In a fragment shader, it will contain the primitive index written by the
mesh shader if a mesh shader is present, or the primitive index written by
the
geometry shader if a geometry shader is present, or with the value that
would have been presented as input to the geometry shader had it been
present.

In an intersection, any-hit, or closest hit shader, it will contain the
index within the geometry of the triangle or bounding box being processed.

|  | When the `PrimitiveId` decoration is applied to an output variable in the
| --- | --- |
mesh shader or
geometry shader, the resulting value is seen through the `PrimitiveId`
decorated input variable in the fragment shader.

The fragment shader using `PrimitiveId` will need to declare either the
`MeshShadingNV`,
`MeshShadingEXT`,
`Geometry` or `Tessellation` capability to satisfy the requirement
SPIR-V has to use `PrimitiveId`. |

`PrimitiveShadingRateKHR`

Decorating a variable with the `PrimitiveShadingRateKHR` built-in
decoration will make that variable contain the
[primitive fragment shading rate](primsrast.html#primsrast-fragment-shading-rate-primitive).

The value written to the variable decorated with
`PrimitiveShadingRateKHR` by the last
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) in the pipeline is used as the
[primitive fragment shading rate](primsrast.html#primsrast-fragment-shading-rate-primitive).
Outputs in previous shader stages are ignored.

If the last active
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) shader entry point’s interface does not include a variable decorated
with `PrimitiveShadingRateKHR`, then it is as if the shader specified a
fragment shading rate value of 0, indicating a horizontal and vertical rate
of 1 pixel.

If a shader has `PrimitiveShadingRateKHR` in the output interface and
there is an execution path through the shader that does not write to it, its
value is **undefined** for executions of the shader that take that path.

that variable contain the [coverage index](primsrast.html#primsrast-multisampling-coverage-mask) for the current fragment shader invocation.
`SampleId` ranges from zero to the number of samples in the framebuffer
minus one.
If a fragment shader entry point’s interface includes an input variable
decorated with `SampleId`, [Sample Shading](primsrast.html#primsrast-sampleshading) is
considered enabled with a `minSampleShading` value of 1.0.

32-bit integer value

`SampleMask`

Decorating a variable with the `SampleMask` built-in decoration will make
any variable contain the [sample mask](fragops.html#fragops-shader-samplemask) for the
current fragment shader invocation.

A variable in the `Input` storage class decorated with `SampleMask`
will contain a bitmask of the set of samples covered by the primitive
generating the fragment during rasterization.
It has a sample bit set if and only if the sample is considered covered for
this fragment shader invocation.
`SampleMask`[] is an array of integers.
Bits are mapped to samples in a manner where bit B of mask M
(`SampleMask[M]`) corresponds to sample 32 × M +  B.

A variable in the `Output` storage class decorated with `SampleMask`
is an array of integers forming a bit array in a manner similar to an input
variable decorated with `SampleMask`, but where each bit represents
coverage as computed by the shader.
This computed `SampleMask` is combined with the generated coverage mask
in the [multisample coverage](fragops.html#fragops-covg) operation.

Variables decorated with `SampleMask` **must** be either an unsized array,
or explicitly sized to be no larger than the implementation-dependent
maximum sample-mask (as an array of 32-bit elements), determined by the
maximum number of samples.

If a fragment shader entry point’s interface includes an output variable
decorated with `SampleMask`, the sample mask will be **undefined** for any
array elements of any fragment shader invocations that fail to assign a
value.
If a fragment shader entry point’s interface does not include an output
variable decorated with `SampleMask`, the sample mask has no effect on
the processing of a fragment.

`SamplePosition`

Decorating a variable with the `SamplePosition` built-in decoration will
make that variable contain the sub-pixel position of the sample being
shaded.
The top left of the pixel is considered to be at coordinate (0,0) and
the bottom right of the pixel is considered to be at coordinate (1,1).

If the render pass has a fragment density map attachment, the variable will
instead contain the sub-fragment position of the sample being shaded.
The top left of the fragment is considered to be at coordinate (0,0)
and the bottom right of the fragment is considered to be at coordinate
(1,1) for any fragment area.

If a fragment shader entry point’s interface includes an input variable
decorated with `SamplePosition`, [Sample Shading](primsrast.html#primsrast-sampleshading) is considered enabled with a `minSampleShading` value of 1.0.

If the current pipeline uses [custom sample locations](primsrast.html#primsrast-samplelocations) the value of any variable decorated with the `SamplePosition`

`SubgroupLocalInvocationId`

Decorating a variable with the `SubgroupLocalInvocationId` builtin
decoration will make that variable contain the index of the invocation
within the subgroup.
This variable is in range [0,`SubgroupSize`-1].

If `VK_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_REQUIRE_FULL_SUBGROUPS_BIT` is
specified,
or if `module` declares SPIR-V version 1.6 or higher, and the local
workgroup size in the X dimension of the `stage` is a multiple of
[`SubgroupSize`](#interfaces-builtin-variables-sgs),
full subgroups are enabled for that pipeline stage.
When full subgroups are enabled, subgroups **must** be launched with all
invocations active, i.e., there is an active invocation with
`SubgroupLocalInvocationId` for each value in range
[0,`SubgroupSize`-1].

|  | There is no direct relationship between `SubgroupLocalInvocationId` and
| --- | --- |
`LocalInvocationId` or `LocalInvocationIndex`.
If the pipeline
or shader object
was created with full subgroups applications can compute their own local
invocation index to serve the same purpose:

index = `SubgroupLocalInvocationId` + `SubgroupId` ×
`SubgroupSize`

If full subgroups are not enabled, some subgroups may be dispatched with
inactive invocations that do not correspond to a local workgroup invocation,
making the value of index unreliable. |

|  | `VK_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_REQUIRE_FULL_SUBGROUPS_BIT`
| --- | --- |
and `VK_SHADER_CREATE_REQUIRE_FULL_SUBGROUPS_BIT_EXT` are
effectively deprecated when compiling SPIR-V 1.6 shaders, as this behavior
is the default for Vulkan with SPIR-V 1.6.
This is more aligned with developer expectations, and avoids applications
unexpectedly breaking in the future. |

`SubgroupSize`

Decorating a variable with the `SubgroupSize` builtin decoration will
make that variable contain the implementation-dependent
[number of invocations in a subgroup](devsandqueues.html#limits-subgroupSize).
This value **must** be a power-of-two integer.

If the pipeline was created with the
`VK_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_ALLOW_VARYING_SUBGROUP_SIZE_BIT` flag
set,
or the shader object was created with the
`VK_SHADER_CREATE_ALLOW_VARYING_SUBGROUP_SIZE_BIT_EXT` flag set,
or the SPIR-V `module` is at least version 1.6,
the `SubgroupSize` decorated variable will contain the subgroup size for
each subgroup that gets dispatched.
This value **must** be between [`minSubgroupSize`](devsandqueues.html#limits-minSubgroupSize) and [`maxSubgroupSize`](devsandqueues.html#limits-maxSubgroupSize) and **must** be uniform with [subgroup scope](shaders.html#shaders-scope-subgroup).
The value **may** vary across a single draw call, and for fragment shaders **may**
vary across a single primitive.
In compute dispatches, `SubgroupSize` **must** be uniform with
[command scope](shaders.html#shaders-scope-command).
In mesh and task shaders, `SubgroupSize` **must** be uniform with
[command scope](shaders.html#shaders-scope-command).
In a single [command scope](shaders.html#shaders-scope-command), the mesh and task
shader **may** have different `SubgroupSize`.

If the pipeline was created with a chained

or the shader object was created with a chained
[VkShaderRequiredSubgroupSizeCreateInfoEXT](pipelines.html#VkShaderRequiredSubgroupSizeCreateInfoEXT) structure,
the `SubgroupSize` decorated variable will match

`ViewportMaskNV`

Decorating a variable with the `ViewportMaskNV` built-in decoration will
make that variable contain the viewport mask.

In a
mesh,
vertex, tessellation evaluation, or geometry shader, the variable decorated
with `ViewportMaskNV` can be written to with the mask of which viewports
the primitive produced by that shader will directed.

The `ViewportMaskNV` variable **must** be an array that has
⌈(`VkPhysicalDeviceLimits`::`maxViewports` / 32)⌉
elements.
When a shader writes to this variable, bit B of element M controls whether a
primitive is emitted to viewport 32 × M +  B.
The viewports indicated by the mask are used to select the
viewport transform, scissor rectangle, and exclusive
scissor rectangle that a primitive will be transformed by.

The last active
*[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization)* (in pipeline order) controls the `ViewportMaskNV` that is used.
Outputs in previous shader stages are not used, even if the last stage fails

shader will have the index of the viewport that was used in generating that
fragment.

`ViewportMaskPerViewNV`

Decorating a variable with the `ViewportMaskPerViewNV` built-in
decoration will make that variable contain the mask of viewports primitives
are broadcast to, for each view.

The value written to an element of `ViewportMaskPerViewNV` in the last
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) is a bitmask indicating which viewports the primitive will be
directed to.
The primitive will be broadcast to the viewport corresponding to each
non-zero bit of the bitmask, and that viewport index is used to select the
viewport transform, scissor rectangle, and exclusive
scissor rectangle, for each view.
The same values **must** be written to all vertices in a given primitive, or
else the set of viewports used for that primitive is **undefined**.

Elements of the array correspond to views in a multiview subpass, and those
elements corresponding to views in the view mask of the subpass the shader
is compiled against will be used as the viewport mask value for those views.
`ViewportMaskPerViewNV` output in an earlier
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) is not available as an input in the subsequent
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization).
