## Content

Command buffers are objects used to record commands which **can** be
subsequently submitted to a device queue for execution.
There are two levels of command buffers - *primary command buffers*, which
**can** execute secondary command buffers, and which are submitted to queues,
and *secondary command buffers*, which **can** be executed by primary command
buffers, and which are not directly submitted to queues.

Command buffers are represented by `VkCommandBuffer` handles:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VK_DEFINE_HANDLE(VkCommandBuffer)

Recorded commands include commands to bind pipelines and descriptor sets to
the command buffer, commands to modify dynamic state, commands to draw (for
graphics rendering), commands to dispatch (for compute), commands to execute
secondary command buffers (for primary command buffers only), commands to
copy buffers and images, and other commands.

Each command buffer manages state independently of other command buffers.
There is no inheritance of state across primary and secondary command
buffers, or between secondary command buffers.
When a command buffer begins recording, all state in that command buffer is
**undefined**.
When secondary command buffer(s) are recorded to execute on a primary
command buffer, the secondary command buffer inherits no state from the
primary command buffer, and all state of the primary command buffer is
**undefined** after an execute secondary command buffer command is recorded.
There is one exception to this rule - if the primary command buffer is
inside a render pass instance, then the render pass and subpass state is not
disturbed by executing secondary command buffers.
For state dependent commands (such as draws and dispatches), any state
consumed by those commands **must** not be **undefined**.

[VkCommandBufferInheritanceViewportScissorInfoNV](#VkCommandBufferInheritanceViewportScissorInfoNV) defines an exception
allowing limited inheritance of dynamic viewport and scissor state.

Unless otherwise specified, and without explicit synchronization, the
various commands submitted to a queue via command buffers **may** execute in
arbitrary order relative to each other, and/or concurrently.
Also, the memory side effects of those commands **may** not be directly visible
to other commands without explicit memory dependencies.
This is true within a command buffer, and across command buffers submitted
to a given queue.
See [the synchronization chapter](synchronization.html#synchronization) for information on
[implicit](synchronization.html#synchronization-implicit) and explicit synchronization between
commands.

Each command buffer is always in one of the following states:

Initial

When a command buffer is [allocated](#vkAllocateCommandBuffers), it is
in the *initial state*.
Some commands are able to *reset* a command buffer (or a set of command
buffers) back to this state from any of the executable, recording or
invalid state.
Command buffers in the initial state **can** only be moved to the recording
state, or freed.

Recording

[vkBeginCommandBuffer](#vkBeginCommandBuffer) changes the state of a command buffer from
the initial state to the *recording state*.
Once a command buffer is in the recording state, `vkCmd*` commands
**can** be used to record to the command buffer.

Executable

[vkEndCommandBuffer](#vkEndCommandBuffer) ends the recording of a command buffer, and
moves it from the recording state to the *executable state*.
Executable command buffers **can** be [    submitted](#commandbuffers-submission), reset, or [recorded to another    command buffer](#commandbuffers-secondary).

Pending

[Queue submission](#commandbuffers-submission) of a command buffer
changes the state of a command buffer from the executable state to the
*pending state*.
Whilst in the pending state, applications **must** not attempt to modify
the command buffer in any way - as the device **may** be processing the
commands recorded to it.
Once execution of a command buffer completes, the command buffer either
reverts back to the *executable state*, or if it was recorded with
`VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_ONE_TIME_SUBMIT_BIT`, it moves to the
*invalid state*.
A [synchronization](synchronization.html#synchronization) command **should** be used to detect
when this occurs.

Invalid

Other than
[VkCommandPool](#VkCommandPool) objects, destroying or freeing any object or memory
that **may** be accessed when the command buffer is accessed (e.g. an
object bound to the command buffer) will transition the state of that
command buffer to the *invalid state*.
The command buffer **must** not be in the *pending state* when this
happens.
Command buffers in the invalid state **can** only be reset or freed.

![commandbuffer lifecycle](../_images/commandbuffer_lifecycle.svg)

Figure 1. Lifecycle of a command buffer

Any given command that operates on a command buffer has its own requirements
on what state a command buffer **must** be in, which are detailed in the valid
usage constraints for that command.

Resetting a command buffer is an operation that discards any previously
recorded commands and puts a command buffer in the *initial state*.
Resetting occurs as a result of [vkResetCommandBuffer](#vkResetCommandBuffer) or
[vkResetCommandPool](#vkResetCommandPool), or as part of [vkBeginCommandBuffer](#vkBeginCommandBuffer) (which
additionally puts the command buffer in the *recording state*).

[Secondary command buffers](#commandbuffers-secondary) **can** be recorded to
a primary command buffer via [vkCmdExecuteCommands](#vkCmdExecuteCommands).
This partially ties the lifecycle of the two command buffers together - if
the primary is submitted to a queue, both the primary and any secondaries
recorded to it move to the *pending state*.
Once execution of the primary completes, so it does for any secondary
recorded within it.
After all executions of each command buffer complete, they each move to
their appropriate completion state (either to the *executable state* or the
*invalid state*, as specified above).

If a secondary moves to the *invalid state* or the *initial state*, then all
primary buffers it is recorded in move to the *invalid state*.
A primary moving to any other state does not affect the state of a secondary
recorded in it.

Command pools are opaque objects that command buffer memory is allocated
from, and which allow the implementation to amortize the cost of resource
creation across multiple command buffers.
Command pools are externally synchronized, meaning that a command pool **must**
not be used concurrently in multiple threads.
That includes use via recording commands on any command buffers allocated
from the pool, as well as operations that allocate, free, and reset command
buffers or the pool itself.

Command pools are represented by `VkCommandPool` handles:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkCommandPool)

To create a command pool, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0

    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkCommandPoolCreateInfo*              pCreateInfo,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator,
    VkCommandPool*                              pCommandPool);

* 
`device` is the logical device that creates the command pool.

* 
`pCreateInfo` is a pointer to a [VkCommandPoolCreateInfo](#VkCommandPoolCreateInfo)

The `VkCommandPoolCreateInfo` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkCommandPoolCreateInfo {
    VkStructureType             sType;
    const void*                 pNext;
    VkCommandPoolCreateFlags    flags;

`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`flags` is a bitmask of [VkCommandPoolCreateFlagBits](#VkCommandPoolCreateFlagBits) indicating
usage behavior for the pool and command buffers allocated from it.

* 
`queueFamilyIndex` designates a queue family as described in section

All command buffers allocated from this command pool **must** be submitted
on queues from the same queue family.

Valid Usage

* 
[](#VUID-VkCommandPoolCreateInfo-flags-02860) VUID-VkCommandPoolCreateInfo-flags-02860

 `pNext` **must** be `NULL`

* 
[](#VUID-VkCommandPoolCreateInfo-flags-parameter) VUID-VkCommandPoolCreateInfo-flags-parameter

 `flags` **must** be a valid combination of [VkCommandPoolCreateFlagBits](#VkCommandPoolCreateFlagBits) values

Bits which **can** be set in [VkCommandPoolCreateInfo](#VkCommandPoolCreateInfo)::`flags`,
specifying usage behavior for a command pool, are:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef enum VkCommandPoolCreateFlagBits {
    VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_TRANSIENT_BIT = 0x00000001,
    VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT = 0x00000002,
  // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
    VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_PROTECTED_BIT = 0x00000004,
} VkCommandPoolCreateFlagBits;

* 
`VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_TRANSIENT_BIT` specifies that command
buffers allocated from the pool will be short-lived, meaning that they
will be reset or freed in a relatively short timeframe.
This flag **may** be used by the implementation to control memory
allocation behavior within the pool.

* 
`VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT` allows any command
buffer allocated from a pool to be individually reset to the
[initial state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle); either by calling
[vkResetCommandBuffer](#vkResetCommandBuffer), or via the implicit reset when calling
[vkBeginCommandBuffer](#vkBeginCommandBuffer).
If this flag is not set on a pool, then `vkResetCommandBuffer` **must**
not be called for any command buffer allocated from that pool.

* 
`VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_PROTECTED_BIT` specifies that command
buffers allocated from the pool are protected command buffers.

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef VkFlags VkCommandPoolCreateFlags;

`VkCommandPoolCreateFlags` is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero
or more [VkCommandPoolCreateFlagBits](#VkCommandPoolCreateFlagBits).

* 
`device` is the logical device that owns the command pool.

* 
`commandPool` is the command pool to trim.

* 
`flags` is reserved for future use.

Trimming a command pool recycles unused memory from the command pool back to
the system.
Command buffers allocated from the pool are not affected by the command.

Resetting a command pool recycles all of the resources from all of the
command buffers allocated from the command pool back to the command pool.
All command buffers that have been allocated from the command pool are put
in the [initial state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle).

Any primary command buffer allocated from another [VkCommandPool](#VkCommandPool) that
is in the [recording or executable state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle) and
has a secondary command buffer allocated from `commandPool` recorded
into it, becomes [invalid](#commandbuffers-lifecycle).

* 
`commandPool` is the handle of the command pool to destroy.

* 
`pAllocator` controls host memory allocation as described in the
[Memory Allocation](memory.html#memory-allocation) chapter.

When a pool is destroyed, all command buffers allocated from the pool are
[freed](#vkFreeCommandBuffers).

Any primary command buffer allocated from another [VkCommandPool](#VkCommandPool) that
is in the [recording or executable state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle) and
has a secondary command buffer allocated from `commandPool` recorded

If a command buffer is in the [invalid, or executable state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle), and the command buffer was allocated from a command pool
with the `VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT` flag set,
then `vkBeginCommandBuffer` implicitly resets the command buffer,
behaving as if `vkResetCommandBuffer` had been called with
`VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_RESET_RELEASE_RESOURCES_BIT` not set.
After the implicit reset, `commandBuffer` is moved to the

If the [`commandBufferInheritance`](features.html#features-commandBufferInheritance)
feature is enabled, all graphics and compute state including bound pipeline
state, bound shader objects, bound vertex and index buffers, bound
descriptor sets and push constants, and all previously set dynamic state is
inherited by the secondary command buffer from the primary or secondary
command buffer that executes it.
Furthermore, all of the state set by this secondary command buffer is
inherited back to the primary or secondard command buffer that executes it.
If the [`commandBufferInheritance`](features.html#features-commandBufferInheritance)
feature is not enabled there is a limited amount of inheritance of state
into the secondary command buffer as specified below.

If the `pNext` chain of [VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo](#VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo) includes a
`VkCommandBufferInheritanceConditionalRenderingInfoEXT` structure, then
that structure controls whether a command buffer **can** be executed while

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`conditionalRenderingEnable` specifies whether the command buffer
**can** be executed while conditional rendering is active in the primary
command buffer.
If this is `VK_TRUE`, then this command buffer **can** be executed
whether the primary command buffer has active conditional rendering or
not.
If this is `VK_FALSE`, then the primary command buffer **must** not

The `VkCommandBufferInheritanceViewportScissorInfoNV` structure is
defined as:

// Provided by VK_NV_inherited_viewport_scissor
typedef struct VkCommandBufferInheritanceViewportScissorInfoNV {
    VkStructureType      sType;
    const void*          pNext;
    VkBool32             viewportScissor2D;
    uint32_t             viewportDepthCount;
    const VkViewport*    pViewportDepths;
} VkCommandBufferInheritanceViewportScissorInfoNV;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`viewportScissor2D` specifies whether the listed dynamic state is
inherited.

* 
`viewportDepthCount` specifies the maximum number of viewports to
inherit.
When `viewportScissor2D` is `VK_FALSE`, the behavior is as if
this value is zero.

* 
`pViewportDepths` is a pointer to a [VkViewport](vertexpostproc.html#VkViewport) structure
specifying the expected depth range for each inherited viewport.

If the `pNext` chain of [VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo](#VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo) includes a
`VkCommandBufferInheritanceViewportScissorInfoNV` structure, then that
structure controls whether a command buffer **can** inherit the following state
from other command buffers:

* 
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_SCISSOR`

* 
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_SCISSOR_WITH_COUNT`

* 
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DISCARD_RECTANGLE_EXT`

* 
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DISCARD_RECTANGLE_ENABLE_EXT`

* 
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DISCARD_RECTANGLE_MODE_EXT`

as well as the following state, with restrictions on inherited depth values
and viewport count:

* 
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT`

* 
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT_WITH_COUNT`

If `viewportScissor2D` is `VK_FALSE`, then the command buffer does
not inherit the listed dynamic state, and **should** set this state itself.
If this structure is not present, the behavior is as if
`viewportScissor2D` is `VK_FALSE`.

If `viewportScissor2D` is `VK_TRUE`, then the listed dynamic state
is inherited, and the command buffer **must** not set this
state, except that the viewport and scissor count **may** be set by binding a
graphics pipeline that does not specify this state as dynamic.

When the command buffer is executed as part of a the execution of a
[vkCmdExecuteCommands](#vkCmdExecuteCommands) command, the inherited state (if enabled) is
determined by the following procedure, performed separately for each dynamic
state, and separately for each value for dynamic state that consists of
multiple values (e.g. multiple viewports).

* 
With i being the index of the executed command buffer in the
`pCommandBuffers` array of [vkCmdExecuteCommands](#vkCmdExecuteCommands), if i >
0 and any secondary command buffer from index 0 to i-1
modifies the state, the inherited state is provisionally set to the
final value set by the last such secondary command buffer.
Binding a graphics pipeline defining the state statically is equivalent
to setting the state to an **undefined** value.

* 
Otherwise, the tentatative inherited state is that of the primary
command buffer at the point the [vkCmdExecuteCommands](#vkCmdExecuteCommands) command was
recorded; if the state is **undefined**, then so is the provisional
inherited state.

* 
If the provisional inherited state is an **undefined** value, then the
state is not inherited.

* 
If the provisional inherited state is a viewport, with n being its
viewport index, then if n ≥ `viewportDepthCount`, or if
either [VkViewport](vertexpostproc.html#VkViewport)::`minDepth` or
[VkViewport](vertexpostproc.html#VkViewport)::`maxDepth` are not equal to the respective values
of the nth element of `pViewportDepths`, then the state is
not inherited.

* 
If the provisional inherited state passes both checks, then it becomes
the actual inherited state.

Once recording starts, an application records a sequence of commands
(`vkCmd*`) to set state in the command buffer, draw, dispatch, and other
commands.

Several commands can also be recorded indirectly from `VkBuffer`
content, see [Device-Generated Commands](device_generated_commands/generatedcommands.html#device-generated-commands).

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer to complete recording.

The command buffer **must** have been in the [recording state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle), and, if successful, is moved to the

If there was an error during recording, the application will be notified by
an unsuccessful return code returned by `vkEndCommandBuffer`, and the
command buffer will be moved to the [invalid state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle).

In case the application recorded one or more [video encode operations](videocoding.html#video-encode-operations) into the command buffer, implementations **may** return the

When a command buffer is in the executable state, it **can** be submitted to a
queue for execution.

To submit command buffers to a queue, call:

    VkFence                                     fence);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_synchronization2

    const VkSubmitInfo2*                        pSubmits,
    VkFence                                     fence);

* 
`queue` is the queue that the command buffers will be submitted to.

* 
`submitCount` is the number of elements in the `pSubmits` array.

* 
`pSubmits` is a pointer to an array of [VkSubmitInfo2](#VkSubmitInfo2)
structures, each specifying a command buffer submission batch.
Command buffers and semaphores specified in this array **may** be accessed
at any point until the [queue operations](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission)
they define complete execution on the device.

* 
`fence` is an **optional** handle to a fence to be signaled once all
submitted command buffers have completed execution.
If `fence` is not [VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE), it defines a
[fence signal operation](synchronization.html#synchronization-fences-signaling).
If it is not [VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE), `fence` **may** be accessed at any
point until this command completes on the device.

`vkQueueSubmit2` is a [queue submission command](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission), with each batch defined by an element of `pSubmits`.

Semaphore operations submitted with [vkQueueSubmit2](#vkQueueSubmit2) have additional
ordering constraints compared to other submission commands, with
dependencies involving previous and subsequent queue operations.
Information about these additional constraints can be found in the
[semaphore](synchronization.html#synchronization-semaphores) section of [the synchronization chapter](synchronization.html#synchronization).

If any command buffer submitted to this queue is in the
[executable state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle), it is moved to the
[pending state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle).
Once execution of all submissions of a command buffer complete, it moves
from the [pending state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle), back to the
[executable state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle).
If a command buffer was recorded with the
`VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_ONE_TIME_SUBMIT_BIT` flag, it instead moves
back to the [invalid state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle).

If `vkQueueSubmit2` fails, it **may** return
`VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` or `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY`.
If it does, the implementation **must** ensure that the state and contents of
any resources or synchronization primitives referenced by the submitted
command buffers and any semaphores referenced by `pSubmits` is
unaffected by the call or its failure.
If `vkQueueSubmit2` fails in such a way that the implementation is
unable to make that guarantee, the implementation **must** return
`VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`.

`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`stripeSemaphoreInfoCount` is the number of semaphores used to
signal stripe completion in the render pass instances in the submitted
command buffer.

* 
`pStripeSemaphoreInfos` is a pointer to an array of
`stripeSemaphoreInfoCount` [VkSemaphoreSubmitInfo](#VkSemaphoreSubmitInfo) structures
describing the semaphores used to signal stripe completion.

This structure can be included in the `pNext` chain of
[VkCommandBufferSubmitInfo](#VkCommandBufferSubmitInfo) to provide a set of semaphores to be
signaled for each striped render pass instance.

The elements of `pStripeSemaphoreInfos` are mapped to render pass
instances in [VkCommandBufferSubmitInfo](#VkCommandBufferSubmitInfo)::`commandBuffer` in
submission order and in stripe order within each render pass instance.
Each semaphore in `pStripeSemaphoreInfos` is signaled when the
implementation has completed execution of the associated stripe.
In a render pass instance that has multiview enabled, the stripe includes
all views in the view mask.
In a render pass instance with `layerCount` greater than 1, the stripe
includes all layers.

Render pass instances that specify the `VK_RENDERING_RESUMING_BIT` will
not have any elements of `pStripeSemaphoreInfos` mapped to them.
Instead, for suspending and resuming render pass instances, this mapping is
done for the first suspending render pass instance, and the per-stripe
semaphores are only signaled for the last resuming render pass instance.

To submit command buffers to a queue, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VkResult vkQueueSubmit(
    VkQueue                                     queue,
    uint32_t                                    submitCount,
    const VkSubmitInfo*                         pSubmits,
    VkFence                                     fence);

* 
`queue` is the queue that the command buffers will be submitted to.

* 
`submitCount` is the number of elements in the `pSubmits` array.

* 
`pSubmits` is a pointer to an array of [VkSubmitInfo](#VkSubmitInfo)
structures, each specifying a command buffer submission batch.
Command buffers and semaphores specified in this array **may** be accessed
at any point until the [queue operations](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission)
they define complete execution on the device.

* 
`fence` is an **optional** handle to a fence to be signaled once all
submitted command buffers have completed execution.
If `fence` is not [VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE), it defines a
[fence signal operation](synchronization.html#synchronization-fences-signaling).
If it is not [VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE), `fence` **may** be accessed at any
point until this command completes on the device.

`vkQueueSubmit` is a [queue submission command](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission), with each batch defined by an element of `pSubmits`.
Batches begin execution in the order they appear in `pSubmits`, but **may**
complete out of order.

Fence and semaphore operations submitted with [vkQueueSubmit](#vkQueueSubmit) have
additional ordering constraints compared to other submission commands, with
dependencies involving previous and subsequent queue operations.
Information about these additional constraints can be found in the
[semaphore](synchronization.html#synchronization-semaphores) and [fence](synchronization.html#synchronization-fences) sections of [the synchronization chapter](synchronization.html#synchronization).

Details on the interaction of `pWaitDstStageMask` with synchronization
are described in the [semaphore wait operation](synchronization.html#synchronization-semaphores-waiting) section of [the synchronization chapter](synchronization.html#synchronization).

The order that batches appear in `pSubmits` is used to determine
[submission order](synchronization.html#synchronization-submission-order), and thus all the
[implicit ordering guarantees](synchronization.html#synchronization-implicit) that respect it.
Other than these implicit ordering guarantees and any [explicit synchronization primitives](synchronization.html#synchronization), these batches **may** overlap or
otherwise execute out of order.

If any command buffer submitted to this queue is in the
[executable state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle), it is moved to the
[pending state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle).
Once execution of all submissions of a command buffer complete, it moves
from the [pending state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle), back to the
[executable state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle).
If a command buffer was recorded with the
`VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_ONE_TIME_SUBMIT_BIT` flag, it instead moves to
the [invalid state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle).

If `vkQueueSubmit` fails, it **may** return
`VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` or `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY`.
If it does, the implementation **must** ensure that the state and contents of
any resources or synchronization primitives referenced by the submitted
command buffers and any semaphores referenced by `pSubmits` is
unaffected by the call or its failure.
If `vkQueueSubmit` fails in such a way that the implementation is unable
to make that guarantee, the implementation **must** return
`VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`.
See [Lost Device](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-lost-device).

`counterPassIndex` **must** be less than the number of counter passes
required by any queries within the batch.
The required number of counter passes for a performance query is
obtained by calling

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_SUBMIT_INFO_KHR`

When using binary semaphores, the application **must** ensure that command
buffer submissions will be able to complete without any subsequent
operations by the application on any queue.
After any call to `vkQueueSubmit` (or other queue operation), for every
queued wait on a semaphore
created with a [VkSemaphoreType](synchronization.html#VkSemaphoreType) of `VK_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY`
there **must** be a prior signal of that semaphore that will not be consumed by
a different wait on the semaphore.

When using timeline semaphores, wait-before-signal behavior is well-defined
and applications **can** submit work via `vkQueueSubmit` defining a
[timeline semaphore wait operation](synchronization.html#synchronization-semaphores-waiting)
before submitting a corresponding [semaphore signal operation](synchronization.html#synchronization-semaphores-signaling).
For each [timeline semaphore wait operation](synchronization.html#synchronization-semaphores-waiting) defined by a call to `vkQueueSubmit`, the application **must**
ensure that a corresponding [semaphore signal operation](synchronization.html#synchronization-semaphores-signaling) is executed before forward progress can be
made.

If a command buffer submission waits for any events to be signaled, the
application **must** ensure that command buffer submissions will be able to
complete without any subsequent operations by the application.
Events signaled by the host **must** be signaled before the command buffer
waits on those events.

Secondary command buffers **must** not be directly submitted to a queue.
To record a secondary command buffer to execute as part of a primary command
buffer, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
void vkCmdExecuteCommands(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    commandBufferCount,
    const VkCommandBuffer*                      pCommandBuffers);

* 
`commandBuffer` is a handle to a primary command buffer that the
secondary command buffers are executed in.

* 
`commandBufferCount` is the length of the `pCommandBuffers`
array.

* 
`pCommandBuffers` is a pointer to an array of
`commandBufferCount` secondary command buffer handles, which are
recorded to execute in the primary command buffer in the order they are
listed in the array.

If any element of `pCommandBuffers` was not recorded with the
`VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_BIT` flag, and it was recorded
into any other primary command buffer which is currently in the
[executable or recording state](#commandbuffers-lifecycle), that primary
command buffer becomes [invalid](#commandbuffers-lifecycle).

If the [`nestedCommandBuffer`](features.html#features-nestedCommandBuffer) feature
is enabled it is valid usage for `vkCmdExecuteCommands` to also be
recorded to a [secondary command buffer](../appendices/glossary.html#glossary).

In addition to secondary command buffer execution from primary command
buffers, an implementation **may** support [nested command buffers](../appendices/glossary.html#glossary), which enable secondary command buffers to be executed from other
secondary command buffers.
If the [`nestedCommandBuffer`](features.html#features-nestedCommandBuffer) feature
is enabled, the implementation supports [nested command buffers](../appendices/glossary.html#glossary).

Nested command buffer execution works the same as primary-to-secondary
execution, except that it is subject to some additional
implementation-defined limits.

Each secondary command buffer has a [command buffer nesting level](../appendices/glossary.html#glossary), which is determined at [vkEndCommandBuffer](#vkEndCommandBuffer) time and evaluated
at [vkCmdExecuteCommands](#vkCmdExecuteCommands) time.
A secondary command buffer that executes no other secondary command buffers
has a [command buffer nesting level](../appendices/glossary.html#glossary) of zero.
Otherwise, the [command buffer nesting level](../appendices/glossary.html#glossary) of a secondary
command buffer is equal to the maximum nesting level of all secondary
command buffers executed by that command buffer plus one.
Some implementations **may** have a limit on the maximum nesting level of
secondary command buffers that **can** be recorded.
This limit is advertised in [`maxCommandBufferNestingLevel`](limits.html#limits-maxCommandBufferNestingLevel).

If the [`nestedCommandBufferRendering`](features.html#features-nestedCommandBufferRendering) feature is enabled, the implementation
supports calling [vkCmdExecuteCommands](#vkCmdExecuteCommands) inside secondary command buffers
recorded with `VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_RENDER_PASS_CONTINUE_BIT`.
If the [`nestedCommandBufferSimultaneousUse`](features.html#features-nestedCommandBufferSimultaneousUse) feature is enabled, the
implementation supports calling [vkCmdExecuteCommands](#vkCmdExecuteCommands) with secondary
command buffers recorded with
`VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_BIT`.

Whenever [vkCmdExecuteCommands](#vkCmdExecuteCommands) is recorded inside a secondary command
buffer recorded with `VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_RENDER_PASS_CONTINUE_BIT`,
each member of `pCommandBuffers` **must** have been recorded with a
[VkCommandBufferBeginInfo](#VkCommandBufferBeginInfo) with [VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo](#VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo)
compatible with the [VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo](#VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo) of the command
buffer into which the [vkCmdExecuteCommands](#vkCmdExecuteCommands) call is being recorded.
The [VkCommandBufferInheritanceRenderingInfo](#VkCommandBufferInheritanceRenderingInfo) structures are compatible
when the `VkCommandBufferInheritanceRenderingInfo`::`renderpass` are
[compatible](renderpass.html#renderpass-compatibility), or if they are
[VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE) then the [VkCommandBufferInheritanceRenderingInfo](#VkCommandBufferInheritanceRenderingInfo)
members match, and all other members of
`VkCommandBufferInheritanceRenderingInfo` match.
This requirement applies recursively, down to the most nested command buffer
and up to the command buffer where the render pass was originally begun.

Each command buffer has a piece of state storing the current device mask of
the command buffer.
This mask controls which physical devices within the logical device all
subsequent commands will execute on, including state-setting commands,
action commands, and synchronization commands.

Scissor, exclusive scissor,
and viewport state
(excluding the count of each)
**can** be different values on each physical device (only when set as dynamic
state), and each physical device will render using its local copy of the
state.
Other state is shared between physical devices, such that all physical
devices use the most recently set values for the state.
However, when recording an action command that uses a piece of state, the
most recent command that set that state **must** have included all physical
devices that execute the action command in its current device mask.

The command buffer’s device mask is orthogonal to the
`pCommandBufferDeviceMasks` member of [VkDeviceGroupSubmitInfo](#VkDeviceGroupSubmitInfo).
Commands only execute on a physical device if the device index is set in
both device masks.

If the `pNext` chain of [VkCommandBufferBeginInfo](#VkCommandBufferBeginInfo) includes a
`VkDeviceGroupCommandBufferBeginInfo` structure, then that structure
includes an initial device mask for the command buffer.

The `VkDeviceGroupCommandBufferBeginInfo` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef struct VkDeviceGroupCommandBufferBeginInfo {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    const void*        pNext;
    uint32_t           deviceMask;
} VkDeviceGroupCommandBufferBeginInfo;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_device_group
typedef VkDeviceGroupCommandBufferBeginInfo VkDeviceGroupCommandBufferBeginInfoKHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`deviceMask` is the initial value of the command buffer’s device
mask.

The initial device mask also acts as an upper bound on the set of devices
that **can** ever be in the device mask in the command buffer.

If this structure is not present, the initial value of a command buffer’s
device mask includes all physical devices in the logical device when the
command buffer begins recording.

To update the current device mask of a command buffer, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
void vkCmdSetDeviceMask(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    deviceMask);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_device_group
void vkCmdSetDeviceMaskKHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    deviceMask);

* 
`commandBuffer` is command buffer whose current device mask is
modified.

* 
`deviceMask` is the new value of the current device mask.

`deviceMask` is used to filter out subsequent commands from executing on
all physical devices whose bit indices are not set in the mask, except
commands beginning a render pass instance, commands transitioning to the
next subpass in the render pass instance, and commands ending a render pass
instance, which always execute on the set of physical devices whose bit
indices are included in the `deviceMask` member of the
[VkDeviceGroupRenderPassBeginInfo](renderpass.html#VkDeviceGroupRenderPassBeginInfo) structure passed to the command
beginning the corresponding render pass instance.
