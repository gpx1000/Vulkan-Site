## Content

*Features* advertise additional functionality which **can** be enabled in the
API.
If a feature is *supported* by a physical device, it **must** be *enabled* when
creating a [VkDevice](devsandqueues.html#VkDevice) in order to use its associated functionality with
that [VkDevice](devsandqueues.html#VkDevice).
If a feature is *unsupported*, that functionality **cannot** be used with that
[VkDevice](devsandqueues.html#VkDevice).

|  | Features are reported via the extensible structure
| --- | --- |
`VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2`, which was added in the
`[VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2](../appendices/extensions.html#VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2)` extension and included in
Vulkan 1.1.
When new features are added in future Vulkan versions or extensions, each
extension **should** introduce one new feature structure, if needed.
This structure **can** be added to the `pNext` chain of the
`VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2` structure. |

For convenience, new core versions of Vulkan **may** introduce new unified
feature structures for features promoted from extensions.
At the same time, the extension’s original feature structure (if any) is
also promoted to the core API, and is an alias of the extension’s structure.
This results in multiple names for the same feature: in the original
extension’s feature structure and the promoted structure alias, in the
unified feature structure.
When a feature was implicitly supported and enabled in the extension, but an
explicit name was added during promotion, then the extension itself acts as
an alias for the feature as listed in the table below.

All aliases of the same feature in the core API **must** be reported
consistently: either all **must** be reported as supported, or none of them.
When a promoted extension is available, any corresponding feature aliases
**must** be supported.

| Extension | Feature(s) |
| --- | --- |
| `[VK_KHR_shader_draw_parameters](../appendices/extensions.html#VK_KHR_shader_draw_parameters)` | [`shaderDrawParameters`](#features-shaderDrawParameters) |
| `[VK_KHR_draw_indirect_count](../appendices/extensions.html#VK_KHR_draw_indirect_count)` | [`drawIndirectCount`](#features-drawIndirectCount) |
| `[VK_KHR_sampler_mirror_clamp_to_edge](../appendices/extensions.html#VK_KHR_sampler_mirror_clamp_to_edge)` | [`samplerMirrorClampToEdge`](#features-samplerMirrorClampToEdge) |
| `[VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing](../appendices/extensions.html#VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing)` | [`descriptorIndexing`](#features-descriptorIndexing) |
| `[VK_EXT_sampler_filter_minmax](../appendices/extensions.html#VK_EXT_sampler_filter_minmax)` | [`samplerFilterMinmax`](#features-samplerFilterMinmax) |
| `[VK_EXT_shader_viewport_index_layer](../appendices/extensions.html#VK_EXT_shader_viewport_index_layer)` | [`shaderOutputViewportIndex`](#features-shaderOutputViewportIndex), [`shaderOutputLayer`](#features-shaderOutputLayer) |

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
void vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures(
    VkPhysicalDevice                            physicalDevice,
    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures*                   pFeatures);

* 
`physicalDevice` is the physical device from which to query the
supported features.

* 
`pFeatures` is a pointer to a [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures](#VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures)
structure in which the physical device features are returned.
For each feature, a value of `VK_TRUE` specifies that the feature is
supported on this physical device, and `VK_FALSE` specifies that the
feature is not supported.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures-physicalDevice-parameter) VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures-physicalDevice-parameter

 `physicalDevice` **must** be a valid [VkPhysicalDevice](devsandqueues.html#VkPhysicalDevice) handle

* 
[](#VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures-pFeatures-parameter) VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures-pFeatures-parameter

 `pFeatures` **must** be a valid pointer to a [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures](#VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures) structure

Fine-grained features used by a logical device **must** be enabled at
`VkDevice` creation time.
If a feature is enabled that the physical device does not support,
`VkDevice` creation will fail and return
`VK_ERROR_FEATURE_NOT_PRESENT`.

The fine-grained features are enabled by passing a pointer to the
`VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures` structure via the `pEnabledFeatures`
member of the [VkDeviceCreateInfo](devsandqueues.html#VkDeviceCreateInfo) structure that is passed into the
`vkCreateDevice` call.
If a member of `pEnabledFeatures` is `VK_TRUE` or `VK_FALSE`,
then the device will be created with the indicated feature enabled or
disabled, respectively.
Features **can** also be enabled by using the [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](#VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2)
structure.

If an application wishes to enable all features supported by a device, it
**can** simply pass in the `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures` structure that was
previously returned by `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures`.
To disable an individual feature, the application **can** set the desired
member to `VK_FALSE` in the same structure.
Setting `pEnabledFeatures` to `NULL`
and not including a [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](#VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2) in the `pNext` chain
of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](devsandqueues.html#VkDeviceCreateInfo)
is equivalent to setting all members of the structure to `VK_FALSE`.

|  | Some features, such as `robustBufferAccess`, **may** incur a runtime
| --- | --- |
performance cost.
Application writers **should** carefully consider the implications of enabling
all supported features. |

To query supported features defined by the core or extensions, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
void vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2(
    VkPhysicalDevice                            physicalDevice,
    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2*                  pFeatures);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2
void vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR(
    VkPhysicalDevice                            physicalDevice,
    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2*                  pFeatures);

* 
`physicalDevice` is the physical device from which to query the
supported features.

* 
`pFeatures` is a pointer to a [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](#VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2)
structure in which the physical device features are returned.

Each structure in `pFeatures` and its `pNext` chain contains members
corresponding to fine-grained features.
Each structure in `pFeatures` and its `pNext` chain contains
`VkBool32` members corresponding to fine-grained features.
Each such member is returned with a `VK_TRUE` value indicating that
feature is supported on this physical device, or a `VK_FALSE` value
indicating it is unsupported.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2-physicalDevice-parameter) VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2-physicalDevice-parameter

 `physicalDevice` **must** be a valid [VkPhysicalDevice](devsandqueues.html#VkPhysicalDevice) handle

* 
[](#VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2-pFeatures-parameter) VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2-pFeatures-parameter

 `pFeatures` **must** be a valid pointer to a [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](#VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2) structure

The `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 {
    VkStructureType             sType;
    void*                       pNext;
    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures    features;
} VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`features` is a [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures](#VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures) structure describing
the fine-grained features of the Vulkan 1.0 API.

The `pNext` chain of this structure is used to extend the structure with
features defined by extensions.
This structure **can** be used in [vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](#vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2) or **can** be
included in the `pNext` chain of a [VkDeviceCreateInfo](devsandqueues.html#VkDeviceCreateInfo) structure,
in which case it controls which features are enabled in lieu of
`pEnabledFeatures`.

clamping is supported.
If this feature is not enabled, the `depthClampEnable` member of the
[VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo](primsrast.html#VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo) structure **must** be
`VK_FALSE`.
Otherwise, setting `depthClampEnable` to `VK_TRUE` will enable
depth clamping.

* 
 `depthBiasClamp` specifies whether depth
bias clamping is supported.
If this feature is not enabled, the `depthBiasClamp` member of the
[VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo](primsrast.html#VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo) structure **must** be 0.0
unless the `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BIAS` dynamic state is enabled,
in which case the `depthBiasClamp` parameter to

[VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo](primsrast.html#VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo) structure **must** be 1.0
unless the `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LINE_WIDTH` dynamic state is enabled,
in which case the `lineWidth` parameter to [vkCmdSetLineWidth](primsrast.html#vkCmdSetLineWidth)

line widths are indicated by the `lineWidthRange` and
`lineWidthGranularity` members of the `VkPhysicalDeviceLimits`
structure, respectively.

* 
 `largePoints` specifies whether points with
size greater than 1.0 are supported.
If this feature is not enabled, only a point size of 1.0 written by a
shader is supported.
The range and granularity of supported point sizes are indicated by the

`VkPhysicalDeviceLimits` structure, respectively.

* 
 `alphaToOne` specifies whether the
implementation is able to replace the alpha value of the fragment shader
color output in the [Multisample Coverage](fragops.html#fragops-covg) fragment
operation.
If this feature is not enabled, then the `alphaToOneEnable` member
of the [VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo](primsrast.html#VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo) structure **must** be
`VK_FALSE`.
Otherwise setting `alphaToOneEnable` to `VK_TRUE` will enable
alpha-to-one behavior.

To query for additional properties, or if the feature is not enabled,
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties](formats.html#vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties) and
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties](capabilities.html#vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties) **can** be used to check for
supported properties of individual formats as normal.

 `occlusionQueryPrecise` specifies
whether occlusion queries returning actual sample counts are supported.
Occlusion queries are created in a `VkQueryPool` by specifying the
`queryType` of `VK_QUERY_TYPE_OCCLUSION` in the
[VkQueryPoolCreateInfo](queries.html#VkQueryPoolCreateInfo) structure which is passed to
[vkCreateQueryPool](queries.html#vkCreateQueryPool).
If this feature is enabled, queries of this type **can** enable
`VK_QUERY_CONTROL_PRECISE_BIT` in the `flags` parameter to
[vkCmdBeginQuery](queries.html#vkCmdBeginQuery).
If this feature is not supported, the implementation supports only
boolean occlusion queries.
When any samples are passed, boolean queries will return a non-zero
result value, otherwise a result value of zero is returned.
When this feature is enabled and `VK_QUERY_CONTROL_PRECISE_BIT` is
set, occlusion queries will report the actual number of samples passed.

 `pipelineStatisticsQuery`
specifies whether the pipeline statistics queries are supported.

`TessellationPointSize` capability for tessellation control and
evaluation shaders, or if the shader modules **can** declare the
`GeometryPointSize` capability for geometry shaders.

|  | `shaderStorageImageExtendedFormats` feature only adds a guarantee of
| --- | --- |
format support, which is specified for the whole physical device.
Therefore enabling or disabling the feature via [vkCreateDevice](devsandqueues.html#vkCreateDevice) has no
practical effect.

To query for additional properties, or if the feature is not supported,
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties](formats.html#vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties) and
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties](capabilities.html#vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties) **can** be used to check for
supported properties of individual formats, as usual rules allow.

`VK_FORMAT_R32G32_UINT`, `VK_FORMAT_R32G32_SINT`, and
`VK_FORMAT_R32G32_SFLOAT` from `StorageImageExtendedFormats` SPIR-V
capability, are already covered by core Vulkan
[mandatory format support](formats.html#formats-mandatory-features-32bit). |

If this feature is not enabled, resources with a descriptor type of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER` or
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC` **must** be indexed only by
constant integral expressions when aggregated into arrays in shader
code.
This also specifies whether shader modules **can** declare the

constant integral expressions when aggregated into arrays in shader
code.
This also specifies whether shader modules **can** declare the
`StorageBufferArrayDynamicIndexing` capability.

`shaderStorageImageArrayDynamicIndexing` specifies whether arrays of

integral expressions when aggregated into arrays in shader code.
This also specifies whether shader modules **can** declare the
`StorageImageArrayDynamicIndexing` capability.

 `shaderClipDistance` specifies
whether clip distances are supported in shader code.
If this feature is not enabled, any members decorated with the
`ClipDistance` built-in decoration **must** not be read from or written
to in shader modules.

`ClipDistance` capability.

 `shaderCullDistance` specifies
whether cull distances are supported in shader code.
If this feature is not enabled, any members decorated with the
`CullDistance` built-in decoration **must** not be read from or written

capability.
However, this only enables a subset of the storage classes that SPIR-V
allows for the `Int16` SPIR-V capability: Declaring and using 16-bit
integers in the `Private`,
`Workgroup` (for non-Block variables),
and `Function` storage classes is enabled, while declaring them in
the interface storage classes (e.g., `UniformConstant`, `Uniform`,
`StorageBuffer`, `Input`, `Output`, and `PushConstant`) is
not enabled.

This also specifies whether shader modules **can** declare the `MinLod`
capability.

 `sparseBinding` specifies whether
resource memory **can** be managed at opaque sparse block level instead of
at the object level.
If this feature is not enabled, resource memory **must** be bound only on a
per-object basis using the [vkBindBufferMemory](resources.html#vkBindBufferMemory) and
[vkBindImageMemory](resources.html#vkBindImageMemory) commands.
In this case, buffers and images **must** not be created with
`VK_BUFFER_CREATE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT` and
`VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT` set in the `flags` member
of the [VkBufferCreateInfo](resources.html#VkBufferCreateInfo) and [VkImageCreateInfo](resources.html#VkImageCreateInfo) structures,
respectively.
Otherwise resource memory **can** be managed as described in
[Sparse Resource Features](sparsemem.html#sparsememory-sparseresourcefeatures).

 `sparseResidencyBuffer` specifies
whether the device **can** access partially resident buffers.
If this feature is not enabled, buffers **must** not be created with

`VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_2_BIT` **must** not be created with
`VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_RESIDENCY_BIT` set in the `flags` member
of the [VkImageCreateInfo](resources.html#VkImageCreateInfo) structure.

 `sparseResidency4Samples`
specifies whether the physical device **can** access partially resident 2D

`VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_RESIDENCY_BIT` set in the `flags` member
of the [VkImageCreateInfo](resources.html#VkImageCreateInfo) structure.

 `sparseResidencyAliased`
specifies whether the physical device **can** correctly access data aliased
into multiple locations.
If this feature is not enabled, the
`VK_BUFFER_CREATE_SPARSE_ALIASED_BIT` and
`VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_ALIASED_BIT` enum values **must** not be used
in `flags` members of the [VkBufferCreateInfo](resources.html#VkBufferCreateInfo) and
[VkImageCreateInfo](resources.html#VkImageCreateInfo) structures, respectively.

 `variableMultisampleRate`
specifies whether all pipelines that will be bound to a command buffer
during a [subpass which uses no attachments](renderpass.html#renderpass-noattachments)
**must** have the same value for
[VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo](primsrast.html#VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo)::`rasterizationSamples`.
If set to `VK_TRUE`, the implementation supports variable
multisample rates in a subpass which uses no attachments.
If set to `VK_FALSE`, then all pipelines bound in such a subpass
**must** have the same multisample rate.
This has no effect in situations where a subpass uses any attachments.

 `inheritedQueries` specifies whether a
secondary command buffer **may** be executed while a query is active.

The `VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features` structure is defined as:
