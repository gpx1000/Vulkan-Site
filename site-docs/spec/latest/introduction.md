## Content

This document, referred to as the “Vulkan Specification” or just the “Specification” hereafter, describes the Vulkan Application Programming Interface (API). Vulkan is a C99 API designed for explicit control of low-level graphics and compute functionality. The canonical version of the Specification is available in the official Vulkan Registry (https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/). The source files used to generate the Vulkan specification are stored in the Vulkan Documentation Repository (https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs). The source repository additionally has a public issue tracker and allows the submission of pull requests that improve the specification. The Vulkan specification is intended for use by both implementors of the API and application developers seeking to make use of the API, forming a contract between these parties. Specification text may address either party; typically the intended audience can be inferred from context, though some sections are defined to address only one of these parties. (For example, Valid Usage sections only address application developers). Any requirements, prohibitions, recommendations or options defined in specification text are imposed only on the audience of that text. The Vulkan Specification uses a combination of normative terminology and normative descriptions to express the requirements that it imposes on applications and implementations. An application which complies with all normative requirements imposed on applications is said to make valid use of the API; failing to comply with such requirements results in undefined behavior, as discussed in the Valid Usage section below. In the context of this document, an implementation which complies with all normative requirements imposed on implementations is said to be conformant. The Khronos Group imposes additional requirements on implementors who wish to make public statements describing their Vulkan implementations as conformant. These include signing the Vulkan Adopter’s Agreement, paying the associated fee, and making a successful conformance test submission to the Khronos Conformance Process. For details see the Khronos Trademark Guidelines (https://www.khronos.org/legal/khronos-trademark-guidelines). Within this specification, the key words must, required, should, may, and optional are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 - Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). The additional key word optionally is an alternate form of optional, for use where grammatically appropriate. These key words are highlighted in the specification to indicate that they are being used in a specific technical sense. The additional key words can and cannot are to be interpreted as describing the capabilities of an application, as follows: can This word means that the application is able to perform the action described. cannot This word means that the API and/or the execution environment provide no mechanism through which the application can express or accomplish the action described. These key words are never used in text addressing implementors. There is an important distinction between cannot and must not, as used in this Specification. Cannot refers to something the API provides no way for the application to express or accomplish. Must not describes something that the application is able to express, but that is not valid use of the API, and will have undefined and potentially unrecoverable consequences. In the Vulkan Specification, the normative term must is primarily used to describe application behavior, and in particular to constrain what inputs or commands issued by the application to the implementation are considered valid. To constrain implementation behavior, the specification sometimes uses must, but more often simply describes the behavior of the implementation in response to specified commands and inputs. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, such references to implementation behavior describe the behavior of conformant implementations, and express normative requirements which an implementation must satisfy in order to conform to the specification. For example, if the specification says “Under specified condition, the error code VK_ERROR_FEATURE_NOT_PRESENT is returned”, that behavior is a requirement of the specification, and an implementation which does not return that error code under that condition is not conformant. When the normative terms may, should, or optional are used to describe implementation behavior, they define alternative or optional behaviors which a conformant implementation may or may not exhibit. Such statements are also normative. For example, if the specification says "Under specified condition, the implementation should return A but may instead return B", then an implementation that returns either A or B under that condition is conformant (assuming it does not violate other normative requirements), while an implementation that returns anything else is not. References to external documents are considered normative references if the Specification uses normative terminology or normative descriptions to refer to them or their requirements, either as a whole or in part.

Some language in the specification is purely informative, intended to provide background information or make suggestions to implementors or developers. Such language does not impose normative requirements on implementations or applications. All NOTEs are implicitly informative. If an entire chapter, section, or appendix contains only informative language, its title will be suffixed with “(Informative)”. Unless so noted in the title, all chapters, sections, and appendices in this document are normative. The Vulkan Specification makes use of common engineering and graphics terms such as Pipeline, Shader, and Host to identify and describe Vulkan API constructs and their attributes, states, and behaviors. The Glossary defines the basic meanings of these terms in the context of the Specification. The Specification text provides fuller definitions of the terms and may elaborate, extend, or clarify the Glossary definitions. When a term defined in the Glossary is used in normative language within the Specification, the definitions within the Specification govern and supersede any meanings the terms may have in other technical contexts (i.e. outside the Specification). Ratification of a Vulkan core version or extension is a status conferred by vote of the Khronos Board of Promoters, bringing that core version or extension under the umbrella of the Khronos IP Rights Policy. All Vulkan core versions and KHR extensions (including provisional specifications) are ratified, as are some multi-vendor EXT extensions. Ratification status of extensions is described in the Layers & Extensions (Informative) appendix. Ratification status is primarily of interest to IHVs developing GPU hardware and Vulkan implementations. For developers, ratification does not necessarily mean that an extension is “better”, has a more stable API, or is more widely supported than alternative ways of achieving that functionality. Interactions between ratified and non-ratified extensions are not themselves ratified.
