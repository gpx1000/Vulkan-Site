## Content

This appendix defines terms, abbreviations, and API prefixes used in the Specification. The terms defined in this section are used consistently throughout the Specification and may be used with or without capitalization. Accessible (Descriptor Binding) A descriptor binding is accessible to a shader stage if that stage is included in the stageFlags of the descriptor binding. Descriptors using that binding can only be used by stages in which they are accessible. Acquire Operation (Resource) An operation that acquires ownership of an image subresource or buffer range. Active (Descriptor Type) When a descriptor with mutable type is updated with vkUpdateDescriptorSets, the active descriptor type changes. When the descriptor is consumed by shaders, it is the active descriptor type which determines validity, i.e. VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding::descriptorType is replaced with the active descriptor type. A mismatch in active descriptor type and consumption by shader is considered an undefined descriptor. Active (Transform Feedback) Transform feedback is made active after vkCmdBeginTransformFeedbackEXT executes and remains active until vkCmdEndTransformFeedbackEXT executes. While transform feedback is active, data written to variables in the output interface of the last pre-rasterization shader stage of the graphics pipeline are captured to the bound transform feedback buffers if those variables are decorated for transform feedback. Adjacent Vertex A vertex in an adjacency primitive topology that is not part of a given primitive, but is accessible in geometry shaders. Active Object (Ray Tracing) A primitive or instance in a ray tracing acceleration structure which has a corresponding ID, and is not inactive (meaning that it is visible to rays). Advanced Blend Operation Blending performed using one of the blend operation enums introduced by the VK_EXT_blend_operation_advanced extension. See Advanced Blending Operations. Alias (API type/command) An identical definition of another API type/command with the same behavior but a different name. Aliased Range (Memory) A range of a device memory allocation that is bound to multiple resources simultaneously. Allocation Scope An association of a host memory allocation to a parent object or command, where the allocation’s lifetime ends before or at the same time as the parent object is freed or destroyed, or during the parent command. API command Any command defined in the Vulkan specification. These entry points all have a vk prefix. Aspect (Image) Some image types contain multiple kinds (called “aspects”) of data for each pixel, where each aspect is used in a particular way by the pipeline and may be stored differently or separately from other aspects. For example, the color components of an image format make up the color aspect of the image, and can be used as a framebuffer color attachment. Some operations, like depth testing, operate only on specific aspects of an image. Attachment (Render Pass) A zero-based integer index name used in render pass creation to refer to a framebuffer attachment that is accessed by one or more subpasses. The index also refers to an attachment description which includes information about the properties of the image view that will later be attached. Availability Operation An operation that causes the values generated by specified memory write accesses to become available for future access. Available A state of values written to memory that allows them to be made visible. Axis-aligned Bounding Box A box bounding a region in space defined by extents along each axis and thus representing a box where each edge is aligned to one of the major axes. Back-Facing See Facingness. Backward Prediction Sample prediction performed during video decode and encode operations based on reference pictures that occur temporally (in display order) after the current picture. Backward Reference A reference picture that occurs temporally (in display order) after the current picture. Batch A single structure submitted to a queue as part of a queue submission command, describing a set of queue operations to execute. Backwards Compatibility A given version of the API is backwards compatible with an earlier version if an application, relying only on valid behavior and functionality defined by the earlier specification, is able to correctly run against each version without any modification. This assumes no active attempt by that application to not run when it detects a different version. Binary Semaphore A semaphore with a boolean payload indicating whether the semaphore is signaled or unsignaled. Represented by a VkSemaphore object created with a semaphore type of VK_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY . Binding (Memory) An association established between a range of a resource object and a range of a memory object. These associations determine the memory locations affected by operations performed on elements of a resource object. Memory bindings are established using the vkBindBufferMemory command for non-sparse buffer objects, using the vkBindImageMemory command for non-sparse image objects , and using the vkQueueBindSparse command for sparse resources . Blend Constant Four floating-point (RGBA) values used as an input to blending. Blending Arithmetic operations between a fragment color value and a value in a color attachment that produce a final color value to be written to the attachment. Buffer A resource that represents a linear array of data in device memory. Represented by a VkBuffer object. Buffer Device Address A 64-bit value used in a shader to access buffer memory through the PhysicalStorageBuffer storage class. Buffer View An object that represents a range of a specific buffer, and state controlling how the contents are interpreted. Represented by a VkBufferView object. Built-In Variable A variable decorated in a shader, where the decoration makes the variable take values provided by the execution environment or values that are generated by fixed-function pipeline stages.

Video coding blocks have a corresponding coding block size (width and height) defining the dimensions of these elements in units of texels. These dimensions are usually codec-specific and a single video compression standard may support more than one coding block type and size. Video compression standards may use multiple coding block types to organize coding blocks of different kinds and sizes into hierarchies.

Formats can have multiple instances of the same component. Some formats have other notations such as E or X which are not considered a component of the format. Compressed Texel Block An element of an image having a block-compressed format, comprising a rectangular block of texel values that are encoded as a single value in memory. Compressed texel blocks of a particular block-compressed format have a corresponding width, height, and depth defining the dimensions of these elements in units of texels, and a size in bytes of the encoding in memory.

Plane An image plane is part of the representation of an image, containing a subset of the color components necessary to represent the texels in the image and with a contiguous mapping of coordinates to bound memory. Most images consist only of a single plane, but some formats spread the components across multiple image planes. The host-accessible properties of each image plane are accessible for a linear layout using vkGetImageSubresourceLayout. If a multi-planar image is created with the VK_IMAGE_CREATE_DISJOINT_BIT bit set, the image is described as disjoint, and its planes are therefore bound to memory independently.

Sparse blocks of a particular sparse resource have a corresponding size in bytes that they use in the bound memory. Sparse Image Block A sparse block in a sparse partially-resident image. In addition to the sparse block size in bytes, sparse image blocks have a corresponding width, height, and depth defining the dimensions of these elements in units of texels or compressed texel blocks, the latter being used in case of sparse images having a block-compressed format.
