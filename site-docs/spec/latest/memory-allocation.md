## Content

Vulkan memory is broken up into two categories, host memory and device memory. Host memory is memory needed by the Vulkan implementation for non-device-visible storage. This memory may be used to store the implementation’s representation and state of Vulkan objects. Vulkan provides applications the opportunity to perform host memory allocations on behalf of the Vulkan implementation. If this feature is not used, the implementation will perform its own memory allocations. Since most memory allocations are off the critical path, this is not meant as a performance feature. Rather, this can be useful for certain embedded systems, for debugging purposes (e.g. putting a guard page after all host allocations), or for memory allocation logging. Allocators are provided by the application as a pointer to a VkAllocationCallbacks structure: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef struct VkAllocationCallbacks { void* pUserData; PFN_vkAllocationFunction pfnAllocation; PFN_vkReallocationFunction pfnReallocation; PFN_vkFreeFunction pfnFree; PFN_vkInternalAllocationNotification pfnInternalAllocation; PFN_vkInternalFreeNotification pfnInternalFree; } VkAllocationCallbacks; pUserData is a value to be interpreted by the implementation of the callbacks. When any of the callbacks in VkAllocationCallbacks are called, the Vulkan implementation will pass this value as the first parameter to the callback. This value can vary each time an allocator is passed into a command, even when the same object takes an allocator in multiple commands. pfnAllocation is a PFN_vkAllocationFunction pointer to an application-defined memory allocation function. pfnReallocation is a PFN_vkReallocationFunction pointer to an application-defined memory reallocation function. pfnFree is a PFN_vkFreeFunction pointer to an application-defined memory free function. pfnInternalAllocation is a PFN_vkInternalAllocationNotification pointer to an application-defined function that is called by the implementation when the implementation makes internal allocations. pfnInternalFree is a PFN_vkInternalFreeNotification pointer to an application-defined function that is called by the implementation when the implementation frees internal allocations. Valid Usage VUID-VkAllocationCallbacks-pfnAllocation-00632 pfnAllocation must be a valid pointer to a valid application-defined PFN_vkAllocationFunction VUID-VkAllocationCallbacks-pfnReallocation-00633 pfnReallocation must be a valid pointer to a valid application-defined PFN_vkReallocationFunction VUID-VkAllocationCallbacks-pfnFree-00634 pfnFree must be a valid pointer to a valid application-defined PFN_vkFreeFunction VUID-VkAllocationCallbacks-pfnInternalAllocation-00635 If either of pfnInternalAllocation or pfnInternalFree is not NULL, both must be valid callbacks The type of pfnAllocation is: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef void* (VKAPI_PTR *PFN_vkAllocationFunction)( void* pUserData, size_t size, size_t alignment, VkSystemAllocationScope allocationScope); pUserData is the value specified for VkAllocationCallbacks::pUserData in the allocator specified by the application. size is the size in bytes of the requested allocation. alignment is the requested alignment of the allocation in bytes and must be a power of two. allocationScope is a VkSystemAllocationScope value specifying the allocation scope of the lifetime of the allocation, as described here. If pfnAllocation is unable to allocate the requested memory, it must return NULL. If the allocation was successful, it must return a valid pointer to memory allocation containing at least size bytes, and with the pointer value being a multiple of alignment. Correct Vulkan operation cannot be assumed if the application does not follow these rules. For example, pfnAllocation (or pfnReallocation) could cause termination of running Vulkan instance(s) on a failed allocation for debugging purposes, either directly or indirectly. In these circumstances, it cannot be assumed that any part of any affected VkInstance objects are going to operate correctly (even vkDestroyInstance), and the application must ensure it cleans up properly via other means (e.g. process termination). If pfnAllocation returns NULL, and if the implementation is unable to continue correct processing of the current command without the requested allocation, it must treat this as a runtime error, and generate VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY at the appropriate time for the command in which the condition was detected, as described in Return Codes. If the implementation is able to continue correct processing of the current command without the requested allocation, then it may do so, and must not generate VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY as a result of this failed allocation. The type of pfnReallocation is: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef void* (VKAPI_PTR *PFN_vkReallocationFunction)( void* pUserData, void* pOriginal, size_t size, size_t alignment, VkSystemAllocationScope allocationScope); pUserData is the value specified for VkAllocationCallbacks::pUserData in the allocator specified by the application. pOriginal must be either NULL or a pointer previously returned by pfnReallocation or pfnAllocation of a compatible allocator. size is the size in bytes of the requested allocation. alignment is the requested alignment of the allocation in bytes and must be a power of two. allocationScope is a VkSystemAllocationScope value specifying the allocation scope of the lifetime of the allocation, as described here. If the reallocation was successful, pfnReallocation must return an allocation with enough space for size bytes, and the contents of the original allocation from bytes zero to min(original size, new size) - 1 must be preserved in the returned allocation. If size is larger than the old size, the contents of the additional space are undefined. If satisfying these requirements involves creating a new allocation, then the old allocation should be freed. If pOriginal is NULL, then pfnReallocation must behave equivalently to a call to PFN_vkAllocationFunction with the same parameter values (without pOriginal). If size is zero, then pfnReallocation must behave equivalently to a call to PFN_vkFreeFunction with the same pUserData parameter value, and pMemory equal to pOriginal. If pOriginal is non-NULL, the implementation must ensure that alignment is equal to the alignment used to originally allocate pOriginal. If this function fails and pOriginal is non-NULL the application must not free the old allocation. pfnReallocation must follow the same rules for return values as PFN_vkAllocationFunction. The type of pfnFree is: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef void (VKAPI_PTR *PFN_vkFreeFunction)( void* pUserData, void* pMemory); pUserData is the value specified for VkAllocationCallbacks::pUserData in the allocator specified by the application. pMemory is the allocation to be freed. pMemory may be NULL, which the callback must handle safely. If pMemory is non-NULL, it must be a pointer previously allocated by pfnAllocation or pfnReallocation. The application should free this memory. The type of pfnInternalAllocation is: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef void (VKAPI_PTR *PFN_vkInternalAllocationNotification)( void* pUserData, size_t size, VkInternalAllocationType allocationType, VkSystemAllocationScope allocationScope); pUserData is the value specified for VkAllocationCallbacks::pUserData in the allocator specified by the application. size is the requested size of an allocation. allocationType is a VkInternalAllocationType value specifying the requested type of an allocation. allocationScope is a VkSystemAllocationScope value specifying the allocation scope of the lifetime of the allocation, as described here. This is a purely informational callback. The type of pfnInternalFree is: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef void (VKAPI_PTR *PFN_vkInternalFreeNotification)( void* pUserData, size_t size, VkInternalAllocationType allocationType, VkSystemAllocationScope allocationScope); pUserData is the value specified for VkAllocationCallbacks::pUserData in the allocator specified by the application. size is the requested size of an allocation. allocationType is a VkInternalAllocationType value specifying the requested type of an allocation. allocationScope is a VkSystemAllocationScope value specifying the allocation scope of the lifetime of the allocation, as described here. Each allocation has an allocation scope defining its lifetime and which object it is associated with. Possible values passed to the allocationScope parameter of the callback functions specified by VkAllocationCallbacks, indicating the allocation scope, are: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef enum VkSystemAllocationScope { VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_COMMAND = 0, VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_OBJECT = 1, VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_CACHE = 2, VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_DEVICE = 3, VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_INSTANCE = 4, } VkSystemAllocationScope; VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_COMMAND specifies that the allocation is scoped to the duration of the Vulkan command. VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_OBJECT specifies that the allocation is scoped to the lifetime of the Vulkan object that is being created or used. VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_CACHE specifies that the allocation is scoped to the lifetime of a VkPipelineCache or VkValidationCacheEXT object. VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_DEVICE specifies that the allocation is scoped to the lifetime of the Vulkan device. VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_INSTANCE specifies that the allocation is scoped to the lifetime of the Vulkan instance. Most Vulkan commands operate on a single object, or there is a sole object that is being created or manipulated. When an allocation uses an allocation scope of VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_OBJECT or VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_CACHE, the allocation is scoped to the object being created or manipulated. When an implementation requires host memory, it will make callbacks to the application using the most specific allocator and allocation scope available: If an allocation is scoped to the duration of a command, the allocator will use the VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_COMMAND allocation scope. The most specific allocator available is used: if the object being created or manipulated has an allocator, that object’s allocator will be used, else if the parent VkDevice has an allocator it will be used, else if the parent VkInstance has an allocator it will be used. Else, If an allocation is associated with a VkValidationCacheEXT or VkPipelineCache object, the allocator will use the VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_CACHE allocation scope. The most specific allocator available is used (cache, else device, else instance). Else, If an allocation is scoped to the lifetime of an object, that object is being created or manipulated by the command, and that object’s type is not VkDevice or VkInstance, the allocator will use an allocation scope of VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_OBJECT. The most specific allocator available is used (object, else device, else instance). Else, If an allocation is scoped to the lifetime of a device, the allocator will use an allocation scope of VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_DEVICE. The most specific allocator available is used (device, else instance). Else, If the allocation is scoped to the lifetime of an instance and the instance has an allocator, its allocator will be used with an allocation scope of VK_SYSTEM_ALLOCATION_SCOPE_INSTANCE. Otherwise an implementation will allocate memory through an alternative mechanism that is unspecified. Objects that are allocated from pools do not specify their own allocator. When an implementation requires host memory for such an object, that memory is sourced from the object’s parent pool’s allocator. The application is not expected to handle allocating memory that is intended for execution by the host due to the complexities of differing security implementations across multiple platforms. The implementation will allocate such memory internally and invoke an application provided informational callback when these internal allocations are allocated and freed. Upon allocation of executable memory, pfnInternalAllocation will be called. Upon freeing executable memory, pfnInternalFree will be called. An implementation will only call an informational callback for executable memory allocations and frees. The allocationType parameter to the pfnInternalAllocation and pfnInternalFree functions may be one of the following values: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef enum VkInternalAllocationType { VK_INTERNAL_ALLOCATION_TYPE_EXECUTABLE = 0, } VkInternalAllocationType; VK_INTERNAL_ALLOCATION_TYPE_EXECUTABLE specifies that the allocation is intended for execution by the host. An implementation must only make calls into an application-provided allocator during the execution of an API command. An implementation must only make calls into an application-provided allocator from the same thread that called the provoking API command. The implementation should not synchronize calls to any of the callbacks. If synchronization is needed, the callbacks must provide it themselves. The informational callbacks are subject to the same restrictions as the allocation callbacks. If an implementation intends to make calls through a VkAllocationCallbacks structure between the time a vkCreate* command returns and the time a corresponding vkDestroy* command begins, that implementation must save a copy of the allocator before the vkCreate* command returns. The callback functions and any data structures they rely upon must remain valid for the lifetime of the object they are associated with. If an allocator is provided to a vkCreate* command, a compatible allocator must be provided to the corresponding vkDestroy* command. Two VkAllocationCallbacks structures are compatible if memory allocated with pfnAllocation or pfnReallocation in each can be freed with pfnReallocation or pfnFree in the other. An allocator must not be provided to a vkDestroy* command if an allocator was not provided to the corresponding vkCreate* command. If a non-NULL allocator is used, the pfnAllocation, pfnReallocation and pfnFree members must be non-NULL and point to valid implementations of the callbacks. An application can choose to not provide informational callbacks by setting both pfnInternalAllocation and pfnInternalFree to NULL. pfnInternalAllocation and pfnInternalFree must either both be NULL or both be non-NULL. If pfnAllocation or pfnReallocation fail, the implementation may fail object creation and/or generate a VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY error, as appropriate. Allocation callbacks must not call any Vulkan commands. The following sets of rules define when an implementation is permitted to call the allocator callbacks. pfnAllocation or pfnReallocation may be called in the following situations: Allocations scoped to a VkDevice or VkInstance may be allocated from any API command. Allocations scoped to a command may be allocated from any API command. Allocations scoped to a VkPipelineCache may only be allocated from: vkCreatePipelineCache vkMergePipelineCaches for dstCache vkCreateGraphicsPipelines for pipelineCache vkCreateComputePipelines for pipelineCache Allocations scoped to a VkValidationCacheEXT may only be allocated from: vkCreateValidationCacheEXT vkMergeValidationCachesEXT for dstCache vkCreateShaderModule for validationCache in VkShaderModuleValidationCacheCreateInfoEXT Allocations scoped to a VkDescriptorPool may only be allocated from: any command that takes the pool as a direct argument vkAllocateDescriptorSets for the descriptorPool member of its pAllocateInfo parameter vkCreateDescriptorPool Allocations scoped to a VkCommandPool may only be allocated from: any command that takes the pool as a direct argument vkCreateCommandPool vkAllocateCommandBuffers for the commandPool member of its pAllocateInfo parameter any vkCmd* command whose commandBuffer was allocated from that VkCommandPool Allocations scoped to any other object may only be allocated in that object’s vkCreate* command. pfnFree, or pfnReallocation with zero size, may be called in the following situations: Allocations scoped to a VkDevice or VkInstance may be freed from any API command. Allocations scoped to a command must be freed by any API command which allocates such memory. Allocations scoped to a VkPipelineCache may be freed from vkDestroyPipelineCache. Allocations scoped to a VkValidationCacheEXT may be freed from vkDestroyValidationCacheEXT. Allocations scoped to a VkDescriptorPool may be freed from any command that takes the pool as a direct argument Allocations scoped to a VkCommandPool may be freed from: any command that takes the pool as a direct argument vkResetCommandBuffer whose commandBuffer was allocated from that VkCommandPool Allocations scoped to any other object may be freed in that object’s vkDestroy* command. Any command that allocates host memory may also free host memory of the same scope. Device memory is memory that is visible to the device — for example the contents of the image or buffer objects, which can be natively used by the device. Memory properties of a physical device describe the memory heaps and memory types available. To query memory properties, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 void vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties( VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice, VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties* pMemoryProperties); physicalDevice is the handle to the device to query. pMemoryProperties is a pointer to a VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties structure in which the properties are returned. Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties-physicalDevice-parameter physicalDevice must be a valid VkPhysicalDevice handle VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties-pMemoryProperties-parameter pMemoryProperties must be a valid pointer to a VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties structure The VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties { uint32_t memoryTypeCount; VkMemoryType memoryTypes[VK_MAX_MEMORY_TYPES]; uint32_t memoryHeapCount; VkMemoryHeap memoryHeaps[VK_MAX_MEMORY_HEAPS]; } VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties; memoryTypeCount is the number of valid elements in the memoryTypes array. memoryTypes is an array of VK_MAX_MEMORY_TYPES VkMemoryType structures describing the memory types that can be used to access memory allocated from the heaps specified by memoryHeaps. memoryHeapCount is the number of valid elements in the memoryHeaps array. memoryHeaps is an array of VK_MAX_MEMORY_HEAPS VkMemoryHeap structures describing the memory heaps from which memory can be allocated. The VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties structure describes a number of memory heaps as well as a number of memory types that can be used to access memory allocated in those heaps. Each heap describes a memory resource of a particular size, and each memory type describes a set of memory properties (e.g. host cached vs. uncached) that can be used with a given memory heap. Allocations using a particular memory type will consume resources from the heap indicated by that memory type’s heap index. More than one memory type may share each heap, and the heaps and memory types provide a mechanism to advertise an accurate size of the physical memory resources while allowing the memory to be used with a variety of different properties. The number of memory heaps is given by memoryHeapCount and is less than or equal to VK_MAX_MEMORY_HEAPS. Each heap is described by an element of the memoryHeaps array as a VkMemoryHeap structure. The number of memory types available across all memory heaps is given by memoryTypeCount and is less than or equal to VK_MAX_MEMORY_TYPES. Each memory type is described by an element of the memoryTypes array as a VkMemoryType structure. At least one heap must include VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT in VkMemoryHeap::flags. If there are multiple heaps that all have similar performance characteristics, they may all include VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT. In a unified memory architecture (UMA) system there is often only a single memory heap which is considered to be equally “local” to the host and to the device, and such an implementation must advertise the heap as device-local. Memory contents within a tile memory heap, denoted by VK_MEMORY_HEAP_TILE_MEMORY_BIT_QCOM, are only visible across the command buffers executed in a single command buffer submission batch within a vkQueueSubmit or vkQueueSubmit2 call. If the VkPhysicalDeviceTileMemoryHeapPropertiesQCOM::queueSubmitBoundary property is set, the visibility is extended across all batches in the submit call. Memory contents are discarded and made undefined after the respective submission batch or submit call. Tile memory may have different performance characteristics than non tile memory. Tile memory can be used simultaneously by command buffers in other queues without invalidating each others contents. Collectively, these rules define the tile memory scope. Tile memory heaps work differently than most heaps as it is allowing addressing on device cache memory. Therefore, the heap’s address space is aliased across the different queues, with each queue retaining its individual copy of the heap. The implementation takes care of any required saving and restoring of the tile memory contents. Effectively, this means that the same address in the heap in different queues have simultaneously different defined contents and the contents has a lifespan scoped to the submit or batch for that specific queues. Each memory type returned by vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties must have its propertyFlags set to one of the following values: 0 VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_PROTECTED_BIT VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_PROTECTED_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_UNCACHED_BIT_AMD VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_UNCACHED_BIT_AMD VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_UNCACHED_BIT_AMD VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_UNCACHED_BIT_AMD VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_UNCACHED_BIT_AMD VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_RDMA_CAPABLE_BIT_NV There must be at least one memory type with both the VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT and VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT bits set in its propertyFlags. There must be at least one memory type with the VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT bit set in its propertyFlags. If the deviceCoherentMemory feature is enabled, there must be at least one memory type with the VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD bit set in its propertyFlags. For each pair of elements X and Y returned in memoryTypes, X must be placed at a lower index position than Y if: the set of bit flags returned in the propertyFlags member of X is a strict subset of the set of bit flags returned in the propertyFlags member of Y; or the propertyFlags members of X and Y are equal, and X belongs to a memory heap with greater performance (as determined in an implementation-specific manner) ; or the propertyFlags members of Y includes VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD or VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_UNCACHED_BIT_AMD and X does not There is no ordering requirement between X and Y elements for the case their propertyFlags members are not in a subset relation. That potentially allows more than one possible way to order the same set of memory types. Notice that the list of all allowed memory property flag combinations is written in a valid order. But if instead VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT was before VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT, the list would still be in a valid order. There may be a performance penalty for using device coherent or uncached device memory types, and using these accidentally is undesirable. In order to avoid this, memory types with these properties always appear at the end of the list; but are subject to the same rules otherwise.

Device-local memory may have different performance characteristics than host-local memory, and may support different memory property flags. VK_MEMORY_HEAP_MULTI_INSTANCE_BIT specifies that in a logical device representing more than one physical device, there is a per-physical device instance of the heap memory. By default, an allocation from such a heap will be replicated to each physical device’s instance of the heap. VK_MEMORY_HEAP_TILE_MEMORY_BIT_QCOM bit specifies that the heap corresponds to tile memory. // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef VkFlags VkMemoryHeapFlags; VkMemoryHeapFlags is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero or more VkMemoryHeapFlagBits. The VkMemoryType structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef struct VkMemoryType { VkMemoryPropertyFlags propertyFlags; uint32_t heapIndex; } VkMemoryType; heapIndex describes which memory heap this memory type corresponds to, and must be less than memoryHeapCount from the VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties structure. propertyFlags is a bitmask of VkMemoryPropertyFlagBits of properties for this memory type.

This property will be set if and only if the memory type belongs to a heap with the VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT set. VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT bit specifies that memory allocated with this type can be mapped for host access using vkMapMemory. VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT bit specifies that the host cache management commands vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges and vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges are not needed to manage availability and visibility on the host. VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT bit specifies that memory allocated with this type is cached on the host. Host memory accesses to uncached memory are slower than to cached memory, however uncached memory is always host coherent. VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT bit specifies that the memory type only allows device access to the memory. Memory types must not have both VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT and VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT set. Additionally, the object’s backing memory may be provided by the implementation lazily as specified in Lazily Allocated Memory. VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_PROTECTED_BIT bit specifies that the memory type only allows device access to the memory, and allows protected queue operations to access the memory. Memory types must not have VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_PROTECTED_BIT set and any of VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT set, or VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT set, or VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT set. VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD bit specifies that device accesses to allocations of this memory type are automatically made available and visible on the device. If paired with VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT, memory domain operations are also performed automatically between host and device. VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_UNCACHED_BIT_AMD bit specifies that memory allocated with this type is not cached on the device. Uncached device memory is always device coherent. VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_RDMA_CAPABLE_BIT_NV bit specifies that external devices can access this memory directly. For any memory allocated with both the VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT and the VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD, host or device accesses also perform automatic memory domain transfer operations, such that writes are always automatically available and visible to both host and device memory domains. Device coherence is a useful property for certain debugging use cases (e.g. crash analysis, where performing separate coherence actions could mean values are not reported correctly). However, device coherent accesses may be slower than equivalent accesses without device coherence, particularly if they are also device uncached. For device uncached memory in particular, repeated accesses to the same or neighboring memory locations over a short time period (e.g. within a frame) may be slower than it would be for the equivalent cached memory type. As such, it is generally inadvisable to use device coherent or device uncached memory except when really needed. // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef VkFlags VkMemoryPropertyFlags; VkMemoryPropertyFlags is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero or more VkMemoryPropertyFlagBits. If the VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT structure is included in the pNext chain of VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties2, it is filled with the current memory budgets and usages. The VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_EXT_memory_budget typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT { VkStructureType sType; void* pNext; VkDeviceSize heapBudget[VK_MAX_MEMORY_HEAPS]; VkDeviceSize heapUsage[VK_MAX_MEMORY_HEAPS]; } VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. heapBudget is an array of VK_MAX_MEMORY_HEAPS VkDeviceSize values in which memory budgets are returned, with one element for each memory heap. A heap’s budget is a rough estimate of how much memory the process can allocate from that heap before allocations may fail or cause performance degradation. The budget includes any currently allocated device memory. heapUsage is an array of VK_MAX_MEMORY_HEAPS VkDeviceSize values in which memory usages are returned, with one element for each memory heap. A heap’s usage is an estimate of how much memory the process is currently using in that heap. The values returned in this structure are not invariant. The heapBudget and heapUsage values must be zero for array elements greater than or equal to VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties::memoryHeapCount. The heapBudget value must be non-zero for array elements less than VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties::memoryHeapCount. The heapBudget value must be less than or equal to VkMemoryHeap::size for each heap. Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT-sType-sType sType must be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MEMORY_BUDGET_PROPERTIES_EXT A Vulkan device operates on data in device memory via memory objects that are represented in the API by a VkDeviceMemory handle: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkDeviceMemory) To allocate memory objects, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 VkResult vkAllocateMemory( VkDevice device, const VkMemoryAllocateInfo* pAllocateInfo, const VkAllocationCallbacks* pAllocator, VkDeviceMemory* pMemory); device is the logical device that owns the memory. pAllocateInfo is a pointer to a VkMemoryAllocateInfo structure describing parameters of the allocation. A successfully returned allocation must use the requested parameters — no substitution is permitted by the implementation. pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the Memory Allocation chapter. pMemory is a pointer to a VkDeviceMemory handle in which information about the allocated memory is returned. Allocations returned by vkAllocateMemory are guaranteed to meet any alignment requirement of the implementation. For example, if an implementation requires 128 byte alignment for images and 64 byte alignment for buffers, the device memory returned through this mechanism would be 128-byte aligned. This ensures that applications can correctly suballocate objects of different types (with potentially different alignment requirements) in the same memory object. When memory is allocated, its contents are undefined with the following constraint: The contents of unprotected memory must not be a function of the contents of data protected memory objects, even if those memory objects were previously freed. The contents of memory allocated by one application should not be a function of data from protected memory objects of another application, even if those memory objects were previously freed. The maximum number of valid memory allocations that can exist simultaneously within a VkDevice may be restricted by implementation- or platform-dependent limits. The maxMemoryAllocationCount feature describes the number of allocations that can exist simultaneously before encountering these internal limits. For historical reasons, if maxMemoryAllocationCount is exceeded, some implementations may return VK_ERROR_TOO_MANY_OBJECTS. Exceeding this limit will result in undefined behavior, and an application should not rely on the use of the returned error code in order to identify when the limit is reached. Many protected memory implementations involve complex hardware and system software support, and often have additional and much lower limits on the number of simultaneous protected memory allocations (from memory types with the VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_PROTECTED_BIT property) than for non-protected memory allocations. These limits can be system-wide, and depend on a variety of factors outside of the Vulkan implementation, so they cannot be queried in Vulkan. Applications should use as few allocations as possible from such memory types by suballocating aggressively, and be prepared for allocation failure even when there is apparently plenty of capacity remaining in the memory heap. As a guideline, the Vulkan conformance test suite requires that at least 80 minimum-size allocations can exist concurrently when no other uses of protected memory are active in the system. Some platforms may have a limit on the maximum size of a single allocation. For example, certain systems may fail to create allocations with a size greater than or equal to 4GB. Such a limit is implementation-dependent, and if such a failure occurs then the error VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY must be returned. This limit is advertised in VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance3Properties::maxMemoryAllocationSize. The cumulative memory size allocated to a heap can be limited by the size of the specified heap. In such cases, allocated memory is tracked on a per-device and per-heap basis. Some platforms allow overallocation into other heaps. The overallocation behavior can be specified through the VK_AMD_memory_overallocation_behavior extension. If the memoryTypeIndex belongs to a heap with the VK_MEMORY_HEAP_TILE_MEMORY_BIT_QCOM bit included in its properties, this allocation is backed by tile memory, which is an on device cache. Unlike other heaps, allocations out of the tile memory will always have a starting address at the start of the heap and its contents are aliased with all other VkDeviceMemory objects bound to the same range while executing within the same tile memory scope. If the VkPhysicalDevicePageableDeviceLocalMemoryFeaturesEXT::pageableDeviceLocalMemory feature is enabled, memory allocations made from a heap that includes VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT in VkMemoryHeap::flags may be transparently moved to host-local memory allowing multiple applications to share device-local memory. If there is no space left in device-local memory when this new allocation is made, other allocations may be moved out transparently to make room. The operating system will determine which allocations to move to device-local memory or host-local memory based on platform-specific criteria. To help the operating system make good choices, the application should set the appropriate memory priority with VkMemoryPriorityAllocateInfoEXT and adjust it as necessary with vkSetDeviceMemoryPriorityEXT. Higher priority allocations will moved to device-local memory first. Memory allocations made on heaps without the VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT property will not be transparently promoted to device-local memory by the operating system.

The internal data of an allocated device memory object must include a reference to implementation-specific resources, referred to as the memory object’s payload. Applications can also import and export that internal data to and from device memory objects to share data between Vulkan instances and other compatible APIs. A VkMemoryAllocateInfo structure defines a memory import operation if its pNext chain includes one of the following structures: VkImportMemoryWin32HandleInfoKHR with a non-zero handleType value VkImportMemoryFdInfoKHR with a non-zero handleType value VkImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT with a non-zero handleType value VkImportAndroidHardwareBufferInfoANDROID with a non-NULL buffer value VkImportMemoryZirconHandleInfoFUCHSIA with a non-zero handleType value VkImportMemoryBufferCollectionFUCHSIA VkImportScreenBufferInfoQNX with a non-NULL buffer value VkImportMemoryMetalHandleInfoEXT with a non-zero handleType value If the parameters define an import operation and the external handle type is VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_D3D11_TEXTURE_BIT, VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_D3D11_TEXTURE_KMT_BIT, or VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_D3D12_RESOURCE_BIT, allocationSize is ignored. The implementation must query the size of these allocations from the OS. If the parameters define an import operation and the external handle type is VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_MTLTEXTURE_BIT_EXT, allocationSize is ignored. The implementation must query the size of these allocations from the OS. Whether device memory objects constructed via a memory import operation hold a reference to their payload depends on the properties of the handle type used to perform the import, as defined below for each valid handle type. Importing memory must not modify the content of the memory. Implementations must ensure that importing memory does not enable the importing Vulkan instance to access any memory or resources in other Vulkan instances other than that corresponding to the memory object imported. Implementations must also ensure accessing imported memory which has not been initialized does not allow the importing Vulkan instance to obtain data from the exporting Vulkan instance or vice-versa. How exported and imported memory is isolated is left to the implementation, but applications should be aware that such isolation may prevent implementations from placing multiple exportable memory objects in the same physical or virtual page. Hence, applications should avoid creating many small external memory objects whenever possible. Importing memory must not increase overall heap usage within a system. However, it must affect the following per-process values: VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxMemoryAllocationCount VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT::heapUsage When performing a memory import operation, it is the responsibility of the application to ensure the external handles and their associated payloads meet all valid usage requirements. However, implementations must perform sufficient validation of external handles and payloads to ensure that the operation results in a valid memory object which will not cause program termination, device loss, queue stalls, or corruption of other resources when used as allowed according to its allocation parameters. If the external handle provided does not meet these requirements, the implementation must fail the memory import operation with the error code VK_ERROR_INVALID_EXTERNAL_HANDLE. If the parameters define an export operation and the external handle type is VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_ANDROID_HARDWARE_BUFFER_BIT_ANDROID, implementations should not strictly follow memoryTypeIndex. Instead, they should modify the allocation internally to use the required memory type for the application’s given usage. This is because for an export operation, there is currently no way for the application to know the memory type index before allocating.

Importing memory from a host pointer shares ownership of the memory between the host and the Vulkan implementation. The application can continue to access the memory through the host pointer but it is the application’s responsibility to synchronize device and non-device access to the payload as defined in Host Access to Device Memory Objects. Applications can import the same payload into multiple instances of Vulkan and multiple times into a given Vulkan instance. However, implementations may fail to import the same payload multiple times into a given physical device due to platform constraints. Importing memory from a particular host pointer may not be possible due to additional platform-specific restrictions beyond the scope of this specification in which case the implementation must fail the memory import operation with the error code VK_ERROR_INVALID_EXTERNAL_HANDLE_KHR. Whether device memory objects imported from a host pointer hold a reference to their payload is undefined. As such, the application must ensure that the imported memory range remains valid and accessible for the lifetime of the imported memory object. Implementations may support importing host pointers for memory types which are not host-visible. In this case, after a successful call to vkAllocateMemory, the memory range imported from pHostPointer must not be accessed by the application until the VkDeviceMemory has been destroyed. Memory contents for the host memory becomes undefined on import, and is left undefined after the VkDeviceMemory has been destroyed. Applications must also not access host memory which is mapped to the same physical memory as pHostPointer, but mapped to a different host pointer while the VkDeviceMemory handle is valid. Implementations running on general-purpose operating systems should not support importing host pointers for memory types which are not host-visible. Using host pointers to back non-host visible allocations is a platform-specific use case, and applications should not attempt to do this unless instructed by the platform.

The formatFeatures member must include VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT and at least one of VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_MIDPOINT_CHROMA_SAMPLES_BIT or VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_COSITED_CHROMA_SAMPLES_BIT, and should include VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_FILTER_LINEAR_BIT and VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_YCBCR_CONVERSION_LINEAR_FILTER_BIT. The formatFeatures member only indicates the features available when using an external-format image created from the Android hardware buffer. Images from Android hardware buffers with a format other than VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED are subject to the format capabilities obtained from vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties2, and vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties2 with appropriate parameters. These sets of features are independent of each other, e.g. the external format will support sampler Y′CBCR conversion even if the non-external format does not, and rendering directly to the external format will not be supported even if the non-external format does support this. Android hardware buffers with the same external format must have the same support for VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_FILTER_LINEAR_BIT, VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_MIDPOINT_CHROMA_SAMPLES_BIT, VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_COSITED_CHROMA_SAMPLES_BIT, VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_YCBCR_CONVERSION_LINEAR_FILTER_BIT, VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_YCBCR_CONVERSION_SEPARATE_RECONSTRUCTION_FILTER_BIT, and VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_YCBCR_CONVERSION_CHROMA_RECONSTRUCTION_EXPLICIT_FORCEABLE_BIT. in formatFeatures. Other format features may differ between Android hardware buffers that have the same external format. This allows applications to use the same VkSamplerYcbcrConversion object (and samplers and pipelines created from them) for any Android hardware buffers that have the same external format. If format is not VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED, then the value of samplerYcbcrConversionComponents must be valid when used as the components member of VkSamplerYcbcrConversionCreateInfo with that format. If format is VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED, all members of samplerYcbcrConversionComponents must be the identity swizzle. Implementations may not always be able to determine the color model, numerical range, or chroma offsets of the image contents, so the values in VkAndroidHardwareBufferFormatPropertiesANDROID are only suggestions. Applications should treat these values as sensible defaults to use in the absence of more reliable information obtained through some other means. If the underlying physical device is also usable via OpenGL ES with the GL_OES_EGL_image_external extension, the implementation should suggest values that will produce similar sampled values as would be obtained by sampling the same external image via samplerExternalOES in OpenGL ES using equivalent sampler parameters. Since GL_OES_EGL_image_external does not require the same sampling and conversion calculations as Vulkan does, achieving identical results between APIs may not be possible on some implementations.

External memory on Fuchsia is imported and exported using VMO handles of type zx_handle_t. VMO handles to external memory are canonically obtained from Fuchsia’s Sysmem service or from syscalls such as zx_vmo_create(). VMO handles for import can also be obtained by exporting them from another Vulkan instance as described in exporting fuchsia device memory. Importing VMO handles to the Vulkan instance transfers ownership of the handle to the instance from the application. The application must not perform any operations on the handle after successful import. Applications can import the same underlying memory into multiple instances of Vulkan, into the same instance from which it was exported, and multiple times into a given Vulkan instance. In all cases, each import operation must create a distinct VkDeviceMemory object.

A Vulkan implementation that is layered on top of Metal on Apple device platform, and implements the VK_EXT_metal_objects extension, supports the ability to import and export the underlying Metal objects associated with specific Vulkan objects. The underlying Metal objects associated with certain Vulkan objects can be exported from those Vulkan objects using the pNext chain of the VkExportMetalObjectsInfoEXT parameter of the vkExportMetalObjectsEXT command. An VkDeviceMemory object can be allocated on an existing MTLBuffer object, by including the MTLBuffer object in a VkImportMetalBufferInfoEXT structure in the pNext chain of the VkMemoryAllocateInfo structure in the vkAllocateMemory command. A new VkImage object can be created on an existing IOSurface object, or one or more existing Metal MTLTexture objects, by including those Metal objects in either VkImportMetalIOSurfaceInfoEXT or VkImportMetalTextureInfoEXT structures in the pNext chain of the VkImageCreateInfo structure in the vkCreateImage command. To export Metal objects from Vulkan objects, the application must first indicate the intention to do so during the creation of the Vulkan object, by including one or more VkExportMetalObjectCreateInfoEXT structures in the pNext chain of the VkInstanceCreateInfo, VkMemoryAllocateInfo, VkImageCreateInfo, VkImageViewCreateInfo, VkBufferViewCreateInfo, VkSemaphoreCreateInfo, or VkEventCreateInfo, in the corresponding Vulkan object creation command. The VkExportMetalObjectCreateInfoEXT structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_EXT_metal_objects typedef struct VkExportMetalObjectCreateInfoEXT { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; VkExportMetalObjectTypeFlagBitsEXT exportObjectType; } VkExportMetalObjectCreateInfoEXT; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. exportObjectType is a VkExportMetalObjectTypeFlagBitsEXT indicating the type of Metal object that the application may request to be exported from the Vulkan object.

If VK_MEMORY_ALLOCATE_DEVICE_MASK_BIT is not set, the number of instances allocated depends on whether VK_MEMORY_HEAP_MULTI_INSTANCE_BIT is set in the memory heap.

If VK_MEMORY_HEAP_MULTI_INSTANCE_BIT is not set, then a single instance of memory is allocated (as if deviceMask is set to one). On some implementations, allocations from a multi-instance heap may consume memory on all physical devices even if the deviceMask excludes some devices. If VkPhysicalDeviceGroupProperties::subsetAllocation is VK_TRUE, then memory is only consumed for the devices in the device mask.

VK_MEMORY_ALLOCATE_DEVICE_ADDRESS_CAPTURE_REPLAY_BIT specifies that the memory’s address can be saved and reused on a subsequent run (e.g. for trace capture and replay), see VkBufferOpaqueCaptureAddressCreateInfo for more detail.

If opaqueCaptureAddress is zero, no specific address is requested. If opaqueCaptureAddress is not zero, it should be an address retrieved from vkGetDeviceMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddress on an identically created memory allocation on the same implementation. In most cases, it is expected that a non-zero opaqueAddress is an address retrieved from vkGetDeviceMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddress on an identically created memory allocation. If this is not the case, it is likely that VK_ERROR_INVALID_OPAQUE_CAPTURE_ADDRESS errors will occur. This is, however, not a strict requirement because trace capture/replay tools may need to adjust memory allocation parameters for imported memory.

Before freeing a memory object, an application must ensure the memory object is no longer in use by the device — for example by command buffers in the pending state. Memory can be freed whilst still bound to resources, but those resources must not be used afterwards. Freeing a memory object releases the reference it held, if any, to its payload. If there are still any bound images or buffers, the memory object’s payload may not be immediately released by the implementation, but must be released by the time all bound images and buffers have been destroyed. Once all references to a payload are released, it is returned to the heap from which it was allocated. How memory objects are bound to Images and Buffers is described in detail in the Resource Memory Association section. If a memory object is mapped at the time it is freed, it is implicitly unmapped. As described below, host writes are not implicitly flushed when the memory object is unmapped, but the implementation must guarantee that writes that have not been flushed do not affect any other memory.

Memory objects created with the memory property VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT are considered mappable. Memory objects must be mappable in order to be successfully mapped on the host. To retrieve a host virtual address pointer to a region of a mappable memory object, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 VkResult vkMapMemory( VkDevice device, VkDeviceMemory memory, VkDeviceSize offset, VkDeviceSize size, VkMemoryMapFlags flags, void** ppData); device is the logical device that owns the memory. memory is the VkDeviceMemory object to be mapped. offset is a zero-based byte offset from the beginning of the memory object. size is the size of the memory range to map, or VK_WHOLE_SIZE to map from offset to the end of the allocation. flags is a bitmask of VkMemoryMapFlagBits specifying additional parameters of the memory map operation. ppData is a pointer to a void* variable in which a host-accessible pointer to the beginning of the mapped range is returned. The value of the returned pointer minus offset must be aligned to VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::minMemoryMapAlignment. After a successful call to vkMapMemory the memory object memory is considered to be currently host mapped. It is an application error to call vkMapMemory on a memory object that is already host mapped. vkMapMemory will fail if the implementation is unable to allocate an appropriately sized contiguous virtual address range, e.g. due to virtual address space fragmentation or platform limits. In such cases, vkMapMemory must return VK_ERROR_MEMORY_MAP_FAILED. The application can improve the likelihood of success by reducing the size of the mapped range and/or removing unneeded mappings using vkUnmapMemory. vkMapMemory does not check whether the device memory is currently in use before returning the host-accessible pointer. The application must guarantee that any previously submitted command that writes to this range has completed before the host reads from or writes to that range, and that any previously submitted command that reads from that range has completed before the host writes to that region (see here for details on fulfilling such a guarantee). If the device memory was allocated without the VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT set, these guarantees must be made for an extended range: the application must round down the start of the range to the nearest multiple of VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::nonCoherentAtomSize, and round the end of the range up to the nearest multiple of VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::nonCoherentAtomSize. While a range of device memory is host mapped, the application is responsible for synchronizing both device and host access to that memory range. It is important for the application developer to become meticulously familiar with all of the mechanisms described in the chapter on Synchronization and Cache Control as they are crucial to maintaining memory access ordering. Calling vkMapMemory is equivalent to calling vkMapMemory2 with an empty pNext chain.

This flag must not be used with vkMapMemory as there is no way to specify the placement address. // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef VkFlags VkMemoryMapFlags; VkMemoryMapFlags is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero or more VkMemoryMapFlagBits. Alternatively, to retrieve a host virtual address pointer to a region of a mappable memory object, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4 VkResult vkMapMemory2( VkDevice device, const VkMemoryMapInfo* pMemoryMapInfo, void** ppData); or the equivalent command // Provided by VK_KHR_map_memory2 VkResult vkMapMemory2KHR( VkDevice device, const VkMemoryMapInfo* pMemoryMapInfo, void** ppData); device is the logical device that owns the memory. pMemoryMapInfo is a pointer to a VkMemoryMapInfo structure describing parameters of the map. ppData is a pointer to a void * variable in which is returned a host-accessible pointer to the beginning of the mapped range. This pointer minus VkMemoryMapInfo::offset must be aligned to at least VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::minMemoryMapAlignment.

The implementation will place the memory map at the specified address, replacing any existing maps in the specified memory range. Replacing memory maps in this way does not implicitly unmap Vulkan memory objects. Instead, the application must ensure no other Vulkan memory objects are mapped anywhere in the specified virtual address range. If successful, ppData will be set to the same value as VkMemoryMapPlacedInfoEXT::pPlacedAddress and vkMapMemory2 will return VK_SUCCESS. If it cannot place the map at the requested address for any reason, the memory object is left unmapped and vkMapMemory2 will return VK_ERROR_MEMORY_MAP_FAILED. The VkMemoryMapPlacedInfoEXT structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_EXT_map_memory_placed typedef struct VkMemoryMapPlacedInfoEXT { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; void* pPlacedAddress; } VkMemoryMapPlacedInfoEXT; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. pPlacedAddress is the virtual address at which to place the address. If VkMemoryMapInfo::flags does not contain VK_MEMORY_MAP_PLACED_BIT_EXT, this value is ignored. Valid Usage VUID-VkMemoryMapPlacedInfoEXT-flags-09576 If VkMemoryMapInfo::flags contains VK_MEMORY_MAP_PLACED_BIT_EXT, pPlacedAddress must not be NULL VUID-VkMemoryMapPlacedInfoEXT-pPlacedAddress-09577 pPlacedAddress must be aligned to an integer multiple of VkPhysicalDeviceMapMemoryPlacedPropertiesEXT::minPlacedMemoryMapAlignment VUID-VkMemoryMapPlacedInfoEXT-pPlacedAddress-09578 The address range specified by pPlacedAddress and VkMemoryMapInfo::size must not overlap any existing Vulkan memory object mapping Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-VkMemoryMapPlacedInfoEXT-sType-sType sType must be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_MEMORY_MAP_PLACED_INFO_EXT Two commands are provided to enable applications to work with non-coherent memory allocations: vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges and vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges. If the memory object was created with the VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT set, vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges and vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges are unnecessary and may have a performance cost. However, availability and visibility operations still need to be managed on the device. See the description of host access types for more information. While memory objects imported from a handle type of VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_HOST_ALLOCATION_BIT_EXT or VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_HOST_MAPPED_FOREIGN_MEMORY_BIT_EXT are inherently mapped to host address space, they are not considered to be host mapped device memory unless they are explicitly host mapped using vkMapMemory. That means flushing or invalidating host caches with respect to host accesses performed on such memory through the original host pointer specified at import time is the responsibility of the application and must be performed with appropriate synchronization primitives provided by the platform which are outside the scope of Vulkan. vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges and vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges, however, can still be used on such memory objects to synchronize host accesses performed through the host pointer of the host mapped device memory range returned by vkMapMemory. After a successful call to vkMapMemory or vkMapMemory2 the memory object memory is considered to be currently host mapped. To flush ranges of non-coherent memory from the host caches, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 VkResult vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges( VkDevice device, uint32_t memoryRangeCount, const VkMappedMemoryRange* pMemoryRanges); device is the logical device that owns the memory ranges. memoryRangeCount is the length of the pMemoryRanges array. pMemoryRanges is a pointer to an array of VkMappedMemoryRange structures describing the memory ranges to flush. vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges guarantees that host writes to the memory ranges described by pMemoryRanges are made available to the host memory domain, such that they can be made available to the device memory domain via memory domain operations using the VK_ACCESS_HOST_WRITE_BIT access type. The first synchronization scope includes all host operations that happened-before it, as defined by the host memory model. Some systems allow writes that do not directly integrate with the host memory model; these have to be synchronized by the application manually. One example of this is non-temporal store instructions on x86; to ensure these happen-before submission, applications should call _mm_sfence(). The second synchronization scope is empty. The first access scope includes host writes to the specified memory ranges. When a host write to a memory location is made available in this way, each whole aligned set of nonCoherentAtomSize bytes that the memory location exists in will also be made available as if they were written by the host. For example, with a nonCoherentAtomSize of 128, if an application writes to the first byte of a memory object via a host mapping, the first 128 bytes of the memory object will be made available by this command. While the value of the following 127 bytes will be unchanged, this does count as an access for the purpose of synchronization, so care must be taken to avoid data races. The second access scope is empty. Unmapping non-coherent memory does not implicitly flush the host mapped memory, and host writes that have not been flushed may not ever be visible to the device. However, implementations must ensure that writes that have not been flushed do not become visible to any other memory. The above guarantee avoids a potential memory corruption in scenarios where host writes to a mapped memory object have not been flushed before the memory is unmapped (or freed), and the virtual address range is subsequently reused for a different mapping (or memory allocation). Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges-device-parameter device must be a valid VkDevice handle VUID-vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges-pMemoryRanges-parameter pMemoryRanges must be a valid pointer to an array of memoryRangeCount valid VkMappedMemoryRange structures VUID-vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges-memoryRangeCount-arraylength memoryRangeCount must be greater than 0 Return Codes Success VK_SUCCESS Failure VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY To invalidate ranges of non-coherent memory from the host caches, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 VkResult vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges( VkDevice device, uint32_t memoryRangeCount, const VkMappedMemoryRange* pMemoryRanges); device is the logical device that owns the memory ranges. memoryRangeCount is the length of the pMemoryRanges array. pMemoryRanges is a pointer to an array of VkMappedMemoryRange structures describing the memory ranges to invalidate. vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges guarantees that device writes to the memory ranges described by pMemoryRanges, which have been made available to the host memory domain using the VK_ACCESS_HOST_WRITE_BIT and VK_ACCESS_HOST_READ_BIT access types, are made visible to the host. If a range of non-coherent memory is written by the host and then invalidated without first being flushed, its contents are undefined. The first synchronization scope includes all host operations that happened-before it, as defined by the host memory model. This function does not synchronize with device operations directly - other host synchronization operations that depend on device operations such as vkWaitForFences must be executed beforehand. So for any non-coherent device write to be made visible to the host, there has to be a dependency chain along the following lines: Device write Device memory barrier including host reads in its second scope Signal on the device (e.g. a fence signal operation) Wait on the host (e.g. vkWaitForFences) vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges The second synchronization scope includes all host operations that happen-after it, as defined by the host memory model. The first access scope is empty. The second access scope includes host reads to the specified memory ranges. When a device write to a memory location is made visible to the host in this way, each whole aligned set of nonCoherentAtomSize bytes that the memory location exists in will also be made visible as if they were written by the device. For example, with a nonCoherentAtomSize of 128, if an application writes to the first byte of a memory object on the device, the first 128 bytes of the memory object will be made visible by this command. While the value of the following 127 bytes will be unchanged, this does count as an access for the purpose of synchronization, so care must be taken to avoid data races. Mapping non-coherent memory does not implicitly invalidate that memory.

When VK_MEMORY_UNMAP_RESERVE_BIT_EXT is set, the memory unmap operation may fail, in which case the memory object will remain host mapped and vkUnmapMemory2 will return VK_ERROR_MEMORY_MAP_FAILED. // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4 typedef VkFlags VkMemoryUnmapFlags; or the equivalent // Provided by VK_KHR_map_memory2 typedef VkMemoryUnmapFlags VkMemoryUnmapFlagsKHR; VkMemoryUnmapFlags is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero or more VkMemoryUnmapFlagBits. If the memory object is allocated from a heap with the VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT bit set, that object’s backing memory may be provided by the implementation lazily. The actual committed size of the memory may initially be as small as zero (or as large as the requested size), and monotonically increases as additional memory is needed. A memory type with this flag set is only allowed to be bound to a VkImage whose usage flags include VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT_BIT. Using lazily allocated memory objects for framebuffer attachments that are not needed once a render pass instance has completed may allow some implementations to never allocate memory for such attachments. To determine the amount of lazily-allocated memory that is currently committed for a memory object, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 void vkGetDeviceMemoryCommitment( VkDevice device, VkDeviceMemory memory, VkDeviceSize* pCommittedMemoryInBytes); device is the logical device that owns the memory. memory is the memory object being queried. pCommittedMemoryInBytes is a pointer to a VkDeviceSize value in which the number of bytes currently committed is returned, on success.

Protected memory adds the following concepts: Memory: Unprotected device memory, which can be visible to the device and can be visible to the host Protected device memory, which can be visible to the device but must not be visible to the host Resources: Unprotected images and unprotected buffers, to which unprotected memory can be bound Protected images and protected buffers, to which protected memory can be bound Command buffers: Unprotected command buffers, which can be submitted to a device queue to execute unprotected queue operations Protected command buffers, which can be submitted to a protected-capable device queue to execute protected queue operations Device queues: Unprotected device queues, to which unprotected command buffers can be submitted Protected-capable device queues, to which unprotected command buffers or protected command buffers can be submitted Queue submissions Unprotected queue submissions, through which unprotected command buffers can be submitted Protected queue submissions, through which protected command buffers can be submitted Queue operations Unprotected queue operations Protected queue operations When the protectedMemory feature is enabled, all pipelines may be recorded in either protected or unprotected command buffers (or both), which may incur an extra cost on some implementations. This can be mitigated by enabling the pipelineProtectedAccess feature, in which case pipelines created with VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_PROTECTED_ACCESS_ONLY_BIT may only be recorded in protected command buffers, and pipelines created with VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_NO_PROTECTED_ACCESS_BIT may only be recorded in unprotected command buffers. If VkPhysicalDeviceProtectedMemoryProperties::protectedNoFault is VK_FALSE, applications must not perform any of the following operations: Write to unprotected memory within protected queue operations. Access protected memory within protected queue operations other than in framebuffer-space pipeline stages, the compute shader stage, or the transfer stage. Perform a query within protected queue operations. If VkPhysicalDeviceProtectedMemoryProperties::protectedNoFault is VK_TRUE, these operations are valid, but reads will return undefined values, and writes will either be dropped or store undefined values. Additionally, indirect operations must not be performed within protected queue operations. Whether these operations are valid or not, or if any other invalid usage is performed, the implementation must guarantee that: Protected device memory must never be visible to the host. Values written to unprotected device memory must not be a function of values from protected memory. Android’s NDK defines AHardwareBuffer objects, which represent device memory that is shareable across processes and that can be accessed by a variety of media APIs and the hardware used to implement them. These Android hardware buffer objects may be imported into VkDeviceMemory objects for access via Vulkan, or exported from Vulkan. An VkImage or VkBuffer can be bound to the imported or exported VkDeviceMemory object if it is created with VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_ANDROID_HARDWARE_BUFFER_BIT_ANDROID. To remove an unnecessary compile time dependency, an incomplete type definition of AHardwareBuffer is provided in the Vulkan headers: // Provided by VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer struct AHardwareBuffer; The actual AHardwareBuffer type is defined in Android NDK headers. The NDK format, usage, and size/dimensions of an AHardwareBuffer object can be obtained with the AHardwareBuffer_describe function. While Android hardware buffers can be imported to or exported from Vulkan without using that function, valid usage and implementation behavior is defined in terms of the AHardwareBuffer_Desc properties it returns. Android hardware buffer objects are reference-counted using Android NDK functions outside of the scope of this specification. A VkDeviceMemory imported from an Android hardware buffer or that can be exported to an Android hardware buffer must acquire a reference to its AHardwareBuffer object, and must release this reference when the device memory is freed. During the host execution of a Vulkan command that has an Android hardware buffer as a parameter (including indirect parameters via pNext chains), the application must not decrement the Android hardware buffer’s reference count to zero. Android hardware buffers can be mapped and unmapped for CPU access using the NDK functions. These lock and unlock APIs are considered to acquire and release ownership of the Android hardware buffer, and applications must follow the rules described in External Resource Sharing to transfer ownership between the Vulkan instance and these native APIs. Android hardware buffers can be shared with external APIs and Vulkan instances on the same device, and also with foreign devices. When transferring ownership of the Android hardware buffer, the external and foreign special queue families described in Queue Family Ownership Transfer are not identical. All APIs which produce or consume Android hardware buffers are considered to use foreign devices, except OpenGL ES contexts and Vulkan logical devices that have matching device and driver UUIDs. Implementations may treat a transfer to or from the foreign queue family as if it were a transfer to or from the external queue family when the Android hardware buffer’s usage only permits it to be used on the same physical device. Vulkan buffer and image usage flags do not correspond exactly to Android hardware buffer usage flags. When allocating Android hardware buffers with non-Vulkan APIs, if any AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_GPU_* usage bits are included, by default the allocator must allocate the memory in such a way that it supports Vulkan usages and creation flags in the usage equivalence table which do not have Android hardware buffer equivalents. An VkAndroidHardwareBufferUsageANDROID structure can be included in the pNext chain of a VkImageFormatProperties2 structure passed to vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties2 to obtain optimal Android hardware buffer usage flags for specific Vulkan resource creation parameters. Some usage flags returned by these commands are required based on the input parameters, but additional vendor-specific usage flags (AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_VENDOR_*) may also be returned. Any Android hardware buffer allocated with these vendor-specific usage flags and imported to Vulkan must only be bound to resources created with parameters that are a subset of the parameters used to obtain the Android hardware buffer usage, since the memory may have been allocated in a way incompatible with other parameters. If an Android hardware buffer is successfully allocated with additional non-vendor-specific usage flags in addition to the recommended usage, it must support being used in the same ways as an Android hardware buffer allocated with only the recommended usage, and also in ways indicated by the additional usage. Android hardware buffers may represent images using implementation-specific formats, layouts, color models, etc., which do not have Vulkan equivalents. Such external formats are commonly used by external image sources such as video decoders or cameras. Vulkan can import Android hardware buffers that have external formats, but since the image contents are in a possibly proprietary representation, images with external formats must have optimal tiling, and their use is restricted. Images with external formats must only be sampled with a sampler that has Y′CBCR conversion enabled. Images that will be backed by an Android hardware buffer can use an external format by setting VkImageCreateInfo::format to VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED and including a VkExternalFormatANDROID structure in the pNext chain. Images can be created with an external format even if the Android hardware buffer has a format which has an equivalent Vulkan format to enable consistent handling of images from sources that might use either category of format. However, all images created with an external format are subject to the valid usage requirements associated with external formats, even if the Android hardware buffer’s format has a Vulkan equivalent. The external format of an Android hardware buffer can be obtained by passing a VkAndroidHardwareBufferFormatPropertiesANDROID structure to vkGetAndroidHardwareBufferPropertiesANDROID. Android hardware buffers have intrinsic width, height, format, and usage properties, so Vulkan images bound to memory imported from an Android hardware buffer must use dedicated allocations: VkMemoryDedicatedRequirements::requiresDedicatedAllocation must be VK_TRUE for images created with VkExternalMemoryImageCreateInfo::handleTypes that includes VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_ANDROID_HARDWARE_BUFFER_BIT_ANDROID. When creating an image that will be bound to an imported Android hardware buffer, the image creation parameters must be equivalent to the AHardwareBuffer properties as described by the valid usage of VkMemoryAllocateInfo. Similarly, device memory allocated for a dedicated image must not be exported to an Android hardware buffer until it has been bound to that image, and the implementation must return an Android hardware buffer with properties derived from the image: The width and height members of AHardwareBuffer_Desc must be the same as the width and height members of VkImageCreateInfo::extent, respectively. The layers member of AHardwareBuffer_Desc must be the same as the arrayLayers member of VkImageCreateInfo. The format member of AHardwareBuffer_Desc must be equivalent to VkImageCreateInfo::format as defined by AHardwareBuffer Format Equivalence. The usage member of AHardwareBuffer_Desc must include bits corresponding to bits included in VkImageCreateInfo::usage and VkImageCreateInfo::flags where such a correspondence exists according to AHardwareBuffer Usage Equivalence. It may also include additional usage bits, including vendor-specific usages. Presence of vendor usage bits may make the Android hardware buffer only usable in ways indicated by the image creation parameters, even when used outside Vulkan, in a similar way that allocating the Android hardware buffer with usage returned in VkAndroidHardwareBufferUsageANDROID does. Implementations may support fewer combinations of image creation parameters for images with Android hardware buffer external handle type than for non-external images. Support for a given set of parameters can be determined by passing VkExternalImageFormatProperties to vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties2 with handleType set to VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_ANDROID_HARDWARE_BUFFER_BIT_ANDROID. Any Android hardware buffer successfully allocated outside Vulkan with usage that includes AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_GPU_* must be supported when using equivalent Vulkan image parameters. If a given choice of image parameters are supported for import, they can also be used to create an image and memory that will be exported to an Android hardware buffer. Table 1.

After an external entity writes to a AHARDWAREBUFFER_FORMAT_R8G8B8X8_UNORM Android hardware buffer, the values read by Vulkan from the X/A component are undefined. To emulate the traditional behavior of the X component during sampling or blending, applications should use VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_ONE in image view component mappings and VK_BLEND_FACTOR_ONE in color blend factors. There is no way to avoid copying these undefined values when copying from such an image to another image or buffer. 2 The AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_GPU_MIPMAP_COMPLETE flag does not correspond to a Vulkan image usage or creation flag. Instead, its presence indicates that the Android hardware buffer contains a complete mipmap chain, and its absence indicates that the Android hardware buffer contains only a single mip level. 3 Only image usages valid for the format are valid. It would be invalid to take a Android Hardware Buffer with a format of AHARDWAREBUFFER_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM that has a AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_GPU_FRAMEBUFFER usage and try to create an image with VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT. 4 In combination with a hardware buffer format other than BLOB. When using VK_IMAGE_CREATE_MUTABLE_FORMAT_BIT with Android hardware buffer images, applications should use VkImageFormatListCreateInfo to inform the implementation which view formats will be used with the image. For some common sets of format, this allows some implementations to provide significantly better performance when accessing the image via Vulkan. Android hardware buffers with a format of AHARDWAREBUFFER_FORMAT_BLOB and usage that includes AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_GPU_DATA_BUFFER can be used as the backing store for VkBuffer objects. Such Android hardware buffers have a size in bytes specified by their width; height and layers are both 1. Unlike images, buffer resources backed by Android hardware buffers do not require dedicated allocations. Exported AHardwareBuffer objects that do not have dedicated images must have a format of AHARDWAREBUFFER_FORMAT_BLOB, usage must include AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_GPU_DATA_BUFFER, width must equal the device memory allocation size, and height and layers must be 1. The QNX SDP defines _screen_buffer objects, which represent a buffer that the QNX Screen graphics subsystem can use directly in its windowing system APIs. More specifically, a Screen buffer is an area of memory that stores pixel data. It can be attached to Screen windows, streams, or pixmaps. These QNX Screen buffer objects may be imported into VkDeviceMemory objects for access via Vulkan. An VkImage or VkBuffer can be bound to the imported VkDeviceMemory object if it is created with VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_SCREEN_BUFFER_BIT_QNX. struct _screen_buffer is strongly typed, so naming the handle type is redundant. The internal layout and therefore size of a struct _screen_buffer image may depend on native usage flags that do not have corresponding Vulkan counterparts. The design of Screen in the QNX SDP makes it difficult to determine the validity of objects from outside of Screen. Therefore, applications must ensure that QNX Screen buffer objects provided used in various Vulkan interfaces are ones created explicitly with QNX Screen APIs. See QNX SDP documentation for more information. A VkDeviceMemory imported from a QNX Screen buffer has no way to acquire a reference to its _screen_buffer object. Therefore, during the host execution of a Vulkan command that has a QNX Screen buffer as a parameter (including indirect parameters via pNext chains), the application must ensure that the QNX Screen buffer resource remains valid. Generally, for a _screen_buffer object to be valid for use within a Vulkan implementation, the buffer object should have a _screen_buffer::SCREEN_PROPERTY_USAGE that includes at least one of: SCREEN_USAGE_VULKAN, SCREEN_USAGE_OPENGL_ES2, SCREEN_USAGE_OPENGL_ES3, or SCREEN_USAGE_NATIVE. The exact Screen-native usage flags required depends on the Vulkan implementation, and QNX Screen itself will not necessarily enforce these requirements. Note that Screen-native usage flags are in no way related to usage flags in the Vulkan specification. QNX Screen buffers may represent images using implementation-specific formats, layouts, color models, etc., which do not have Vulkan equivalents. Such external formats are commonly used by external image sources such as video decoders or cameras. Vulkan can import QNX Screen buffers that have external formats, but since the image contents are in an undiscoverable and possibly proprietary representation, images with external formats must only be used as sampled images, must only be sampled with a sampler that has Y′CBCR conversion enabled, and must have optimal tiling. Images that will be backed by a QNX Screen buffer can use an external format by setting VkImageCreateInfo::format to VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED and including a VkExternalFormatQNX structure in the pNext chain. Images can be created with an external format even if the QNX Screen buffer has a format which has an equivalent Vulkan format to enable consistent handling of images from sources that might use either category of format. The external format of a QNX Screen buffer can be obtained by passing a VkScreenBufferFormatPropertiesQNX structure to vkGetScreenBufferPropertiesQNX. QNX Screen buffers have intrinsic width, height, format, and usage properties, so Vulkan images bound to memory imported from a QNX Screen buffer must use dedicated allocations: VkMemoryDedicatedRequirements::requiresDedicatedAllocation must be VK_TRUE for images created with VkExternalMemoryImageCreateInfo::handleTypes that includes VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_SCREEN_BUFFER_BIT_QNX. When creating an image that will be bound to an imported QNX Screen buffer, the image creation parameters must be equivalent to the _screen_buffer properties as described by the valid usage of VkMemoryAllocateInfo.

After an external entity writes to a SCREEN_FORMAT_RGBX8888 QNX Screen buffer, the values read by Vulkan from the X/A component are undefined. To emulate the traditional behavior of the X component during sampling or blending, applications should use VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_ONE in image view component mappings and VK_BLEND_FACTOR_ONE in color blend factors. There is no way to avoid copying these undefined values when copying from such an image to another image or buffer. The same behavior applies to the following pairs: SCREEN_FORMAT_BGRA8888 and SCREEN_FORMAT_BGRX8888, SCREEN_FORMAT_RGBA1010102 and SCREEN_FORMAT_RGBX1010102, SCREEN_FORMAT_BGRA1010102 and SCREEN_FORMAT_BGRX1010102, SCREEN_FORMAT_RGBA5551 and SCREEN_FORMAT_RGBX5551 Peer memory is memory that is allocated for a given physical device and then bound to a resource and accessed by a different physical device, in a logical device that represents multiple physical devices. Some ways of reading and writing peer memory may not be supported by a device. To determine how peer memory can be accessed, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1 void vkGetDeviceGroupPeerMemoryFeatures( VkDevice device, uint32_t heapIndex, uint32_t localDeviceIndex, uint32_t remoteDeviceIndex, VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlags* pPeerMemoryFeatures); or the equivalent command // Provided by VK_KHR_device_group void vkGetDeviceGroupPeerMemoryFeaturesKHR( VkDevice device, uint32_t heapIndex, uint32_t localDeviceIndex, uint32_t remoteDeviceIndex, VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlags* pPeerMemoryFeatures); device is the logical device that owns the memory. heapIndex is the index of the memory heap from which the memory is allocated. localDeviceIndex is the device index of the physical device that performs the memory access. remoteDeviceIndex is the device index of the physical device that the memory is allocated for. pPeerMemoryFeatures is a pointer to a VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlags bitmask indicating which types of memory accesses are supported for the combination of heap, local, and remote devices.

VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_DST_BIT specifies that the memory can be accessed as the destination of any vkCmdCopy* command. VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_SRC_BIT specifies that the memory can be read as any memory access type. VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_DST_BIT specifies that the memory can be written as any memory access type. Shader atomics are considered to be writes. The peer memory features of a memory heap also apply to any accesses that may be performed during image layout transitions. VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_DST_BIT must be supported for all host local heaps and for at least one device-local memory heap. If a device does not support a peer memory feature, it is still valid to use a resource that includes both local and peer memory bindings with the corresponding access type as long as only the local bindings are actually accessed. For example, an application doing split-frame rendering would use framebuffer attachments that include both local and peer memory bindings, but would scissor the rendering to only update local memory. // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1 typedef VkFlags VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlags; or the equivalent // Provided by VK_KHR_device_group typedef VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlags VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlagsKHR; VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlags is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero or more VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlagBits. To query a 64-bit opaque capture address value from a memory object, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2 uint64_t vkGetDeviceMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddress( VkDevice device, const VkDeviceMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddressInfo* pInfo); or the equivalent command // Provided by VK_KHR_buffer_device_address uint64_t vkGetDeviceMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddressKHR( VkDevice device, const VkDeviceMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddressInfo* pInfo); device is the logical device that the memory object was allocated on. pInfo is a pointer to a VkDeviceMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddressInfo structure specifying the memory object to retrieve an address for. The 64-bit return value is an opaque address representing the start of pInfo->memory. If the memory object was allocated with a non-zero value of VkMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddressAllocateInfo::opaqueCaptureAddress, the return value must be the same address. The expected usage for these opaque addresses is only for trace capture/replay tools to store these addresses in a trace and subsequently specify them during replay.
