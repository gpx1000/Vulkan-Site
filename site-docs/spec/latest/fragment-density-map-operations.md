## Content

When a fragment is generated in a render pass that has a fragment density
map attachment, its area is determined by the properties of the local
framebuffer region that the fragment occupies.
The framebuffer is divided into a uniform grid of these local regions, and
their fragment area property is derived from the density map with the
following operations:

* 
[Fetch density value](#fragmentdensitymap-fetch-density-value)

[Component swizzle](#fragmentdensitymap-component-swizzle)

* 
[Component mapping](#fragmentdensitymap-component-mapping)

[Fragment area    conversion](#fragmentdensitymap-conversion-to-fragment-area)

* 
[Fragment area filter](#fragmentdensitymap-fragment-area-filter)

* 
[Fragment area clamp](#fragmentdensitymap-fragment-area-clamp)

Each local framebuffer region at center coordinate (x,y) fetches a
texel from the fragment density map.

First, the local framebuffer region center coordinate (x,y) is offset
by the value specified in
[VkRenderPassFragmentDensityMapOffsetEndInfoEXT](renderpass.html#VkRenderPassFragmentDensityMapOffsetEndInfoEXT).
If no offset is specified, then the default offset (0,0) is used.
The offsetted coordinate (x',y') is computed as follows:

  

  

|  | The offset is relative to the fragment density map, so it is subtracted from
| --- | --- |
the framebuffer coordinates to make the adjustment relative to the
framebuffer.

In other words, applying a positive offset in the x component will shift the
fragment density map to the right relative to the framebuffer.
This means the framebuffer coordinates need to undergo a shift to the left. |

The offsetted coordinate (x',y') fetches a texel from the fragment
density map at integer coordinates:

\(i =
\mathbin{clamp}(\left\lfloor{\frac{x'}{fragmentDensityTexelSize_{width}}}\right\rfloor,
0, fragmentDensityMap_{width} - 1)\)

\(j =
\mathbin{clamp}(\left\lfloor{\frac{y'}{fragmentDensityTexelSize_{height}}}\right\rfloor,
0, fragmentDensityMap_{height} - 1)\)

Where the size of each region in the framebuffer is:

\(fragmentDensityTexelSize'_{width} =
{2^{\lceil{\log_2(\frac{framebuffer_{width}}{fragmentDensityMap_{width}})}\rceil}}\)

\(fragmentDensityTexelSize'_{height} =
{2^{\lceil{\log_2(\frac{framebuffer_{height}}{fragmentDensityMap_{height}})}\rceil}}\)

This region is subject to the limits in
`VkPhysicalDeviceFragmentDensityMapPropertiesEXT` and therefore the
final region size is clamped:

\(fragmentDensityTexelSize_{width} =
\mathbin{clamp}(fragmentDensityTexelSize'_{width},minFragmentDensityTexelSize_{width},maxFragmentDensityTexelSize_{width})\)

\(fragmentDensityTexelSize_{height} =
\mathbin{clamp}(fragmentDensityTexelSize'_{height},minFragmentDensityTexelSize_{height},maxFragmentDensityTexelSize_{height})\)

When multiview is enabled for the render pass and the fragment density map
attachment view was created with `layerCount` greater than `1`, the
layer used for offsets and for fetching from the fragment density map is:

  

Otherwise, if the render pass was created with
`VK_RENDER_PASS_CREATE_PER_LAYER_FRAGMENT_DENSITY_BIT_VALVE` specified,
or the dynamic render pass was begun with
`VK_RENDERING_PER_LAYER_FRAGMENT_DENSITY_BIT_VALVE` specified,
then the layer used is:

  

Otherwise:

  

The texel fetched from the density map at (i,j,layer) is next
converted to density with the following operations.

The `components` member of [VkImageViewCreateInfo](resources.html#VkImageViewCreateInfo) is applied to the
fetched texel as defined in [Image component swizzle](textures.html#textures-component-swizzle).

The swizzled texel’s components are mapped to a density value:

  

Fragment area for the framebuffer region is **undefined** if the density
fetched is not a normalized floating-point value greater than `0.0`.
Otherwise, the fetched fragment area for that region is derived as:

  

Optionally, the implementation **may** fetch additional density map texels in
an implementation defined window around (i,j).
The texels follow the standard conversion steps up to and including
[fragment area conversion](#fragmentdensitymap-conversion-to-fragment-area).

A single fetched fragment area for the framebuffer region is chosen by the
implementation and **must** have an area between the *min* and *max* areas of
the fetched set.

The implementation **may** clamp the fetched fragment area to one that it
supports.
The clamped fragment area **must** have a size less than or equal to the
original fetched value.
Implementations **may** vary the supported set of fragment areas per
framebuffer region.
Fragment area (1,1) **must** always be in the supported set.

|  | For example, if the fetched fragment area is (1,4) but the
| --- | --- |
implementation only supports areas of {(1,1),(2,2)}, it could choose
to clamp the area to (2,2) since it has the same size as (1,4).
While this would produce fragments that have lower quality strictly in the
x-axis, the overall density is maintained. |

The clamped fragment area is assigned to the corresponding framebuffer
region.
