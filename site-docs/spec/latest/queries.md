## Content

Queries provide a mechanism to return information about the processing of a sequence of Vulkan commands. Query operations are asynchronous, and as such, their results are not returned immediately. Instead, their results, and their availability status are stored in a Query Pool. The state of these queries can be read back on the host, or copied to a buffer object on the device. The supported query types are Occlusion Queries, Pipeline Statistics Queries, Result Status Queries, Video Encode Feedback Queries and Timestamp Queries. Performance Queries are supported if the associated extension is available. Transform Feedback Queries are supported if the associated extension is available. Intel Performance Queries are supported if the associated extension is available. Mesh Shader Queries are supported if the associated extension is available. Several additional queries with specific purposes associated with ray tracing are available if the corresponding extensions are supported, as described for VkQueryType. Queries are managed using query pool objects. Each query pool is a collection of a specific number of queries of a particular type. Query pools are represented by VkQueryPool handles: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkQueryPool) To create a query pool, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 VkResult vkCreateQueryPool( VkDevice device, const VkQueryPoolCreateInfo* pCreateInfo, const VkAllocationCallbacks* pAllocator, VkQueryPool* pQueryPool); device is the logical device that creates the query pool. pCreateInfo is a pointer to a VkQueryPoolCreateInfo structure containing the number and type of queries to be managed by the pool. pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the Memory Allocation chapter. pQueryPool is a pointer to a VkQueryPool handle in which the resulting query pool object is returned.

The pPerformanceQueryCreateInfo member VkQueryPoolPerformanceCreateInfoKHR::queueFamilyIndex must be a queue family of physicalDevice. The number of passes required to capture the counters specified in the pPerformanceQueryCreateInfo member VkQueryPoolPerformanceCreateInfoKHR::pCounters is returned in pNumPasses.

VK_QUERY_TYPE_PIPELINE_STATISTICS specifies a pipeline statistics query. VK_QUERY_TYPE_TIMESTAMP specifies a timestamp query. VK_QUERY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_KHR specifies a performance query. VK_QUERY_TYPE_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_STREAM_EXT specifies a transform feedback query. VK_QUERY_TYPE_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED_EXT specifies a primitives generated query. VK_QUERY_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_COMPACTED_SIZE_KHR specifies a acceleration structure size query for use with vkCmdWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR or vkWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR. VK_QUERY_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_SERIALIZATION_SIZE_KHR specifies a serialization acceleration structure size query. VK_QUERY_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_SIZE_KHR specifies an acceleration structure size query for use with vkCmdWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR or vkWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR. VK_QUERY_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_SERIALIZATION_BOTTOM_LEVEL_POINTERS_KHR specifies a serialization acceleration structure pointer count query. VK_QUERY_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_COMPACTED_SIZE_NV specifies an acceleration structure size query for use with vkCmdWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesNV. VK_QUERY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_INTEL specifies a Intel performance query. VK_QUERY_TYPE_RESULT_STATUS_ONLY_KHR specifies a result status query. VK_QUERY_TYPE_VIDEO_ENCODE_FEEDBACK_KHR specifies a video encode feedback query. VK_QUERY_TYPE_MESH_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED_EXT specifies a generated mesh primitives query. The operation of queries is controlled by the commands vkCmdBeginQuery, vkCmdEndQuery, vkCmdBeginQueryIndexedEXT, vkCmdEndQueryIndexedEXT, vkCmdResetQueryPool, vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults, vkCmdWriteTimestamp2, and vkCmdWriteTimestamp. In order for a VkCommandBuffer to record query management commands, the queue family for which its VkCommandPool was created must support the appropriate type of operations (graphics, compute) suitable for the query type of a given query pool. Each query in a query pool has a status that is either unavailable or available, and also has state to store the numerical results of a query operation of the type requested when the query pool was created. Resetting a query via vkCmdResetQueryPool or vkResetQueryPool sets the status to unavailable and makes the numerical results undefined. A query is made available by the operation of vkCmdEndQuery, vkCmdEndQueryIndexedEXT, vkCmdWriteTimestamp2, or vkCmdWriteTimestamp. Both the availability status and numerical results can be retrieved by calling either vkGetQueryPoolResults or vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults. After query pool creation, each query is in an uninitialized state and must be reset before it is used. Queries must also be reset between uses. If a logical device includes multiple physical devices, then each command that writes a query must execute on a single physical device, and any call to vkCmdBeginQuery must execute the corresponding vkCmdEndQuery command on the same physical device. To reset a range of queries in a query pool on a queue, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 void vkCmdResetQueryPool( VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, VkQueryPool queryPool, uint32_t firstQuery, uint32_t queryCount); commandBuffer is the command buffer into which this command will be recorded. queryPool is the handle of the query pool managing the queries being reset. firstQuery is the initial query index to reset. queryCount is the number of queries to reset. When executed on a queue, this command sets the status of query indices [firstQuery, firstQuery + queryCount - 1] to unavailable. This command defines an execution dependency between other query commands that reference the same query. The first synchronization scope includes all commands which reference the queries in queryPool indicated by firstQuery and queryCount that occur earlier in submission order. The second synchronization scope includes all commands which reference the queries in queryPool indicated by firstQuery and queryCount that occur later in submission order. The operation of this command happens after the first scope and happens before the second scope. If the queryType used to create queryPool was VK_QUERY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_KHR, this command sets the status of query indices [firstQuery, firstQuery + queryCount - 1] to unavailable for each pass of queryPool, as indicated by a call to vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyPerformanceQueryPassesKHR. Because vkCmdResetQueryPool resets all the passes of the indicated queries, applications must not record a vkCmdResetQueryPool command for a queryPool created with VK_QUERY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_KHR in a command buffer that needs to be submitted multiple times as indicated by a call to vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyPerformanceQueryPassesKHR. Otherwise applications will never be able to complete the recorded queries. Valid Usage VUID-vkCmdResetQueryPool-firstQuery-09436 firstQuery must be less than the number of queries in queryPool VUID-vkCmdResetQueryPool-firstQuery-09437 The sum of firstQuery and queryCount must be less than or equal to the number of queries in queryPool VUID-vkCmdResetQueryPool-None-02841 All queries used by the command must not be active VUID-vkCmdResetQueryPool-firstQuery-02862 If queryPool was created with VK_QUERY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_KHR, this command must not be recorded in a command buffer that, either directly or through secondary command buffers, also contains begin commands for a query from the set of queries [firstQuery, firstQuery + queryCount - 1] Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-vkCmdResetQueryPool-commandBuffer-parameter commandBuffer must be a valid VkCommandBuffer handle VUID-vkCmdResetQueryPool-queryPool-parameter queryPool must be a valid VkQueryPool handle VUID-vkCmdResetQueryPool-commandBuffer-recording commandBuffer must be in the recording state VUID-vkCmdResetQueryPool-commandBuffer-cmdpool The VkCommandPool that commandBuffer was allocated from must support graphics, compute, decode, encode, or optical flow operations VUID-vkCmdResetQueryPool-renderpass This command must only be called outside of a render pass instance VUID-vkCmdResetQueryPool-videocoding This command must only be called outside of a video coding scope VUID-vkCmdResetQueryPool-commonparent Both of commandBuffer, and queryPool must have been created, allocated, or retrieved from the same VkDevice Host Synchronization Host access to commandBuffer must be externally synchronized Host access to the VkCommandPool that commandBuffer was allocated from must be externally synchronized Command Properties Command Buffer Levels Render Pass Scope Video Coding Scope Supported Queue Types Command Type Primary Secondary Outside Outside Graphics Compute Decode Encode Opticalflow Action To reset a range of queries in a query pool on the host, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2 void vkResetQueryPool( VkDevice device, VkQueryPool queryPool, uint32_t firstQuery, uint32_t queryCount); or the equivalent command // Provided by VK_EXT_host_query_reset void vkResetQueryPoolEXT( VkDevice device, VkQueryPool queryPool, uint32_t firstQuery, uint32_t queryCount); device is the logical device that owns the query pool. queryPool is the handle of the query pool managing the queries being reset. firstQuery is the initial query index to reset. queryCount is the number of queries to reset. This command sets the status of query indices [firstQuery, firstQuery + queryCount - 1] to unavailable. If queryPool is VK_QUERY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_KHR this command sets the status of query indices [firstQuery, firstQuery + queryCount - 1] to unavailable for each pass. Valid Usage VUID-vkResetQueryPool-firstQuery-09436 firstQuery must be less than the number of queries in queryPool VUID-vkResetQueryPool-firstQuery-09437 The sum of firstQuery and queryCount must be less than or equal to the number of queries in queryPool VUID-vkResetQueryPool-None-02665 The hostQueryReset feature must be enabled VUID-vkResetQueryPool-firstQuery-02741 Submitted commands that refer to the range specified by firstQuery and queryCount in queryPool must have completed execution VUID-vkResetQueryPool-firstQuery-02742 The range of queries specified by firstQuery and queryCount in queryPool must not be in use by calls to vkGetQueryPoolResults or vkResetQueryPool in other threads Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-vkResetQueryPool-device-parameter device must be a valid VkDevice handle VUID-vkResetQueryPool-queryPool-parameter queryPool must be a valid VkQueryPool handle VUID-vkResetQueryPool-queryPool-parent queryPool must have been created, allocated, or retrieved from device Once queries are reset and ready for use, query commands can be issued to a command buffer. Occlusion queries and pipeline statistics queries count events - drawn samples and pipeline stage invocations, respectively - resulting from commands that are recorded between a vkCmdBeginQuery command and a vkCmdEndQuery command within a specified command buffer, effectively scoping a set of drawing and/or dispatching commands. Timestamp queries write timestamps to a query pool. Performance queries record performance counters to a query pool. A query must begin and end in the same command buffer, although if it is a primary command buffer, and the inheritedQueries feature is enabled, it can execute secondary command buffers during the query operation. For a secondary command buffer to be executed while a query is active, it must set the occlusionQueryEnable, queryFlags, and/or pipelineStatistics members of VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo to conservative values, as described in the Command Buffer Recording section. A query must either begin and end inside the same subpass of a render pass instance, or must both begin and end outside of a render pass instance (i.e. contain entire render pass instances). If queries are used while executing a render pass instance that has multiview enabled, the query uses N consecutive query indices in the query pool (starting at query) where N is the number of bits set in the view mask in the subpass the query is used in. How the numerical results of the query are distributed among the queries is implementation-dependent. For example, some implementations may write each view’s results to a distinct query, while other implementations may write the total result to the first query and write zero to the other queries. However, the sum of the results in all the queries must accurately reflect the total result of the query summed over all views. Applications can sum the results from all the queries to compute the total result. Queries used with multiview rendering must not span subpasses, i.e. they must begin and end in the same subpass. A query must either begin and end inside the same video coding scope, or must both begin and end outside of a video coding scope and must not contain entire video coding scopes. To begin a query, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 void vkCmdBeginQuery( VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, VkQueryPool queryPool, uint32_t query, VkQueryControlFlags flags); commandBuffer is the command buffer into which this command will be recorded. queryPool is the query pool that will manage the results of the query. query is the query index within the query pool that will contain the results. flags is a bitmask of VkQueryControlFlagBits specifying constraints on the types of queries that can be performed. If the queryType of the pool is VK_QUERY_TYPE_OCCLUSION and flags contains VK_QUERY_CONTROL_PRECISE_BIT, an implementation must return a result that matches the actual number of samples passed. This is described in more detail in Occlusion Queries. Calling vkCmdBeginQuery is equivalent to calling vkCmdBeginQueryIndexedEXT with the index parameter set to zero. After beginning a query, that query is considered active within the command buffer it was called in until that same query is ended. Queries active in a primary command buffer when secondary command buffers are executed are considered active for those secondary command buffers. Furthermore, if the query is started within a video coding scope, the following command buffer states are initialized for the query type: The active_query_index is set to the value specified by query. The last activatable query index is also set to the value specified by query. Each video coding operation stores a result to the query corresponding to the current active query index, followed by incrementing the active query index. If the active query index gets incremented past the last activatable query index, issuing any further video coding operations results in undefined behavior. In practice, this means that currently no more than a single video coding operation must be issued between a begin and end query pair. This command defines an execution dependency between other query commands that reference the same query. The first synchronization scope includes all commands which reference the queries in queryPool indicated by query that occur earlier in submission order. The second synchronization scope includes all commands which reference the queries in queryPool indicated by query that occur later in submission order. The operation of this command happens after the first scope and happens before the second scope.

In either case, the layout in memory is defined as follows: The first query’s result is written starting at the first byte requested by the command, and each subsequent query’s result begins stride bytes later. Occlusion queries, pipeline statistics queries, transform feedback queries, primitives generated queries, mesh shader queries, video encode feedback queries, and timestamp queries store results in a tightly packed array of unsigned integers, either 32- or 64-bits as requested by the command, storing the numerical results and, if requested, the availability status. Performance queries store results in a tightly packed array whose type is determined by the unit member of the corresponding VkPerformanceCounterKHR. If VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_AVAILABILITY_BIT is used, the final element of each query’s result is an integer indicating whether the query’s result is available, with any non-zero value indicating that it is available. If VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_STATUS_BIT_KHR is used, the final element of each query’s result is an integer value indicating that status of the query result. Positive values indicate success, negative values indicate failure, and 0 indicates that the result is not yet available. Specific error codes are encoded in the VkQueryResultStatusKHR enumeration. Occlusion queries write one integer value - the number of samples passed. Pipeline statistics queries write one integer value for each bit that is enabled in the pipelineStatistics when the pool is created, and the statistics values are written in bit order starting from the least significant bit. Timestamp queries write one integer value. Performance queries write one VkPerformanceCounterResultKHR value for each VkPerformanceCounterKHR in the query. Transform feedback queries write two integers; the first integer is the number of primitives successfully written to the corresponding transform feedback buffer and the second is the number of primitives output to the vertex stream, regardless of whether they were successfully captured or not. In other words, if the transform feedback buffer was sized too small for the number of primitives output by the vertex stream, the first integer represents the number of primitives actually written and the second is the number that would have been written if all the transform feedback buffers associated with that vertex stream were large enough. Primitives generated queries write the number of primitives output to the vertex stream, regardless of whether transform feedback is active or not, or whether they were successfully captured by transform feedback or not. This is identical to the second integer of the transform feedback queries if transform feedback is active. Mesh shader queries write a single integer. Video encode feedback queries write one or more integer values for each bit that is enabled in VkQueryPoolVideoEncodeFeedbackCreateInfoKHR::encodeFeedbackFlags when the pool is created, and the feedback values are written in bit order starting from the least significant bit, as described here. If more than one query is retrieved and stride is not at least as large as the size of the array of values corresponding to a single query, the values written to memory are undefined. To retrieve status and results for a set of queries, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 VkResult vkGetQueryPoolResults( VkDevice device, VkQueryPool queryPool, uint32_t firstQuery, uint32_t queryCount, size_t dataSize, void* pData, VkDeviceSize stride, VkQueryResultFlags flags); device is the logical device that owns the query pool. queryPool is the query pool managing the queries containing the desired results. firstQuery is the initial query index. queryCount is the number of queries to read. dataSize is the size in bytes of the buffer pointed to by pData. pData is a pointer to an application-allocated buffer where the results will be written stride is the stride in bytes between results for individual queries within pData. flags is a bitmask of VkQueryResultFlagBits specifying how and when results are returned. Any results written for a query are written according to a layout dependent on the query type. If no bits are set in flags, and all requested queries are in the available state, results are written as an array of 32-bit unsigned integer values. Behavior when not all queries are available is described below. If VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_AVAILABILITY_BIT is set, results for all queries in queryPool identified by firstQuery and queryCount are copied to pData, along with an extra availability or status value written directly after the results of each query and interpreted as an unsigned integer. A value of zero indicates that the results are not yet available, otherwise the query is complete and results are available. The size of the availability or status values is 64 bits if VK_QUERY_RESULT_64_BIT is set in flags. Otherwise, it is 32 bits. If VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_STATUS_BIT_KHR is set, results for all queries in queryPool identified by firstQuery and queryCount are copied to pData, along with an extra status value written directly after the results of each query and interpreted as a signed integer. A value of zero indicates that the results are not yet available. Positive values indicate that the operations within the query completed successfully, and the query results are valid. Negative values indicate that the operations within the query completed unsuccessfully. VkQueryResultStatusKHR defines specific meaning for values returned here, though implementations are free to return other values. If the status value written is negative, indicating that the operations within the query completed unsuccessfully, then all other results written by this command are undefined unless otherwise specified for any of the results of the used query type. If VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_AVAILABILITY_BIT or VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_STATUS_BIT_KHR is set, the layout of data in the buffer is a (result,availability) or (result,status) pair for each query returned, and stride is the stride between each pair. Results for any available query written by this command are final and represent the final result of the query. If VK_QUERY_RESULT_PARTIAL_BIT is set, then for any query that is unavailable, an intermediate result between zero and the final result value is written for that query. Otherwise, any result written by this command is undefined. If VK_QUERY_RESULT_64_BIT is set, results and, if returned, availability or status values for all queries are written as an array of 64-bit values. If the queryPool was created with VK_QUERY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_KHR, results for each query are written as an array of the type indicated by VkPerformanceCounterKHR::storage for the counter being queried. Otherwise, results and availability or status values are written as an array of 32-bit values. If an unsigned integer query’s value overflows the result type, the value may either wrap or saturate. If the maintenance7 feature is enabled, for an unsigned integer query, the 32-bit result value must be equal to the 32 least significant bits of the equivalent 64-bit result value. If a signed integer query’s value overflows the result type, the value is undefined. If a floating-point query’s value is not representable as the result type, the value is undefined. If VK_QUERY_RESULT_WAIT_BIT is set, this command defines an execution dependency with any earlier commands that writes one of the identified queries. The first synchronization scope includes all instances of vkCmdEndQuery, vkCmdEndQueryIndexedEXT, vkCmdWriteTimestamp2, and vkCmdWriteTimestamp that reference any query in queryPool indicated by firstQuery and queryCount. The second synchronization scope includes the host operations of this command. If VK_QUERY_RESULT_WAIT_BIT is not set, vkGetQueryPoolResults may return VK_NOT_READY if there are queries in the unavailable state. Applications must take care to ensure that use of the VK_QUERY_RESULT_WAIT_BIT bit has the desired effect. For example, if a query has been used previously and a command buffer records the commands vkCmdResetQueryPool, vkCmdBeginQuery, and vkCmdEndQuery for that query, then the query will remain in the available state until vkResetQueryPool is called or the vkCmdResetQueryPool command executes on a queue. Applications can use fences or events to ensure that a query has already been reset before checking for its results or availability status. Otherwise, a stale value could be returned from a previous use of the query. The above also applies when VK_QUERY_RESULT_WAIT_BIT is used in combination with VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_AVAILABILITY_BIT. In this case, the returned availability status may reflect the result of a previous use of the query unless vkResetQueryPool is called or the vkCmdResetQueryPool command has been executed since the last use of the query. A similar situation can arise with the VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_STATUS_BIT_KHR flag. Applications can double-buffer query pool usage, with a pool per frame, and reset queries at the end of the frame in which they are read. Valid Usage VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-firstQuery-09436 firstQuery must be less than the number of queries in queryPool VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-firstQuery-09437 The sum of firstQuery and queryCount must be less than or equal to the number of queries in queryPool VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-queryCount-09438 If queryCount is greater than 1, stride must not be zero VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-queryType-09439 If the queryType used to create queryPool was VK_QUERY_TYPE_TIMESTAMP, flags must not contain VK_QUERY_RESULT_PARTIAL_BIT VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-queryType-09440 If the queryType used to create queryPool was VK_QUERY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_KHR, flags must not contain VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_AVAILABILITY_BIT, VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_STATUS_BIT_KHR, VK_QUERY_RESULT_PARTIAL_BIT, or VK_QUERY_RESULT_64_BIT VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-queryType-09441 If the queryType used to create queryPool was VK_QUERY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_KHR, the queryPool must have been recorded once for each pass as retrieved via a call to vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyPerformanceQueryPassesKHR VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-queryType-09442 If the queryType used to create queryPool was VK_QUERY_TYPE_RESULT_STATUS_ONLY_KHR, then flags must include VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_STATUS_BIT_KHR VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-flags-09443 If flags includes VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_STATUS_BIT_KHR, then it must not include VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_AVAILABILITY_BIT VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-None-09401 All queries used by the command must not be uninitialized VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-flags-02828 If VK_QUERY_RESULT_64_BIT is not set in flags and the queryType used to create queryPool was not VK_QUERY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_KHR, then pData and stride must be multiples of 4 VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-flags-00815 If VK_QUERY_RESULT_64_BIT is set in flags then pData and stride must be multiples of 8 VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-stride-08993 If VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_AVAILABILITY_BIT is set, stride must be large enough to contain the unsigned integer representing availability or status in addition to the query result VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-queryType-03229 If the queryType used to create queryPool was VK_QUERY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_KHR, then pData and stride must be multiples of the size of VkPerformanceCounterResultKHR VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-queryType-04519 If the queryType used to create queryPool was VK_QUERY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_KHR, then stride must be large enough to contain the VkQueryPoolPerformanceCreateInfoKHR::counterIndexCount used to create queryPool times the size of VkPerformanceCounterResultKHR VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-dataSize-00817 dataSize must be large enough to contain the result of each query, as described here Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-device-parameter device must be a valid VkDevice handle VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-queryPool-parameter queryPool must be a valid VkQueryPool handle VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-pData-parameter pData must be a valid pointer to an array of dataSize bytes VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-flags-parameter flags must be a valid combination of VkQueryResultFlagBits values VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-dataSize-arraylength dataSize must be greater than 0 VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-queryPool-parent queryPool must have been created, allocated, or retrieved from device Return Codes Success VK_SUCCESS VK_NOT_READY Failure VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST Bits which can be set in vkGetQueryPoolResults::flags and vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults::flags, specifying how and when results are returned, are: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef enum VkQueryResultFlagBits { VK_QUERY_RESULT_64_BIT = 0x00000001, VK_QUERY_RESULT_WAIT_BIT = 0x00000002, VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_AVAILABILITY_BIT = 0x00000004, VK_QUERY_RESULT_PARTIAL_BIT = 0x00000008, // Provided by VK_KHR_video_queue VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_STATUS_BIT_KHR = 0x00000010, } VkQueryResultFlagBits; VK_QUERY_RESULT_64_BIT specifies the results will be written as an array of 64-bit unsigned integer values. If this bit is not set, the results will be written as an array of 32-bit unsigned integer values. VK_QUERY_RESULT_WAIT_BIT specifies that Vulkan will wait for each query’s status to become available before retrieving its results. VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_AVAILABILITY_BIT specifies that the availability status accompanies the results. VK_QUERY_RESULT_PARTIAL_BIT specifies that returning partial results is acceptable. VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_STATUS_BIT_KHR specifies that the last value returned in the query is a VkQueryResultStatusKHR value. See result status query for information on how an application can determine whether the use of this flag bit is supported. // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef VkFlags VkQueryResultFlags; VkQueryResultFlags is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero or more VkQueryResultFlagBits. Specific status codes that can be returned from a query are: // Provided by VK_KHR_video_queue typedef enum VkQueryResultStatusKHR { VK_QUERY_RESULT_STATUS_ERROR_KHR = -1, VK_QUERY_RESULT_STATUS_NOT_READY_KHR = 0, VK_QUERY_RESULT_STATUS_COMPLETE_KHR = 1, // Provided by VK_KHR_video_encode_queue VK_QUERY_RESULT_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_BITSTREAM_BUFFER_RANGE_KHR = -1000299000, } VkQueryResultStatusKHR; VK_QUERY_RESULT_STATUS_NOT_READY_KHR specifies that the query result is not yet available. VK_QUERY_RESULT_STATUS_ERROR_KHR specifies that operations did not complete successfully. VK_QUERY_RESULT_STATUS_COMPLETE_KHR specifies that operations completed successfully and the query result is available. VK_QUERY_RESULT_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_BITSTREAM_BUFFER_RANGE_KHR specifies that a video encode operation did not complete successfully due to the destination video bitstream buffer range not being sufficiently large to fit the encoded bitstream data. To copy query statuses and numerical results directly to buffer memory, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 void vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults( VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, VkQueryPool queryPool, uint32_t firstQuery, uint32_t queryCount, VkBuffer dstBuffer, VkDeviceSize dstOffset, VkDeviceSize stride, VkQueryResultFlags flags); commandBuffer is the command buffer into which this command will be recorded. queryPool is the query pool managing the queries containing the desired results. firstQuery is the initial query index. queryCount is the number of queries. firstQuery and queryCount together define a range of queries. dstBuffer is a VkBuffer object that will receive the results of the copy command. dstOffset is an offset into dstBuffer. stride is the stride in bytes between results for individual queries within dstBuffer. The required size of the backing memory for dstBuffer is determined as described above for vkGetQueryPoolResults. flags is a bitmask of VkQueryResultFlagBits specifying how and when results are returned. Any results written for a query are written according to a layout dependent on the query type. Results for any query in queryPool identified by firstQuery and queryCount that is available are copied to dstBuffer. If VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_AVAILABILITY_BIT is set, results for all queries in queryPool identified by firstQuery and queryCount are copied to dstBuffer, along with an extra availability value written directly after the results of each query and interpreted as an unsigned integer. A value of zero indicates that the results are not yet available, otherwise the query is complete and results are available. If VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_STATUS_BIT_KHR is set, results for all queries in queryPool identified by firstQuery and queryCount are copied to dstBuffer, along with an extra status value written directly after the results of each query and interpreted as a signed integer. A value of zero indicates that the results are not yet available. Positive values indicate that the operations within the query completed successfully, and the query results are valid. Negative values indicate that the operations within the query completed unsuccessfully. VkQueryResultStatusKHR defines specific meaning for values returned here, though implementations are free to return other values. If the status value written is negative, indicating that the operations within the query completed unsuccessfully, then all other results written by this command are undefined unless otherwise specified for any of the results of the used query type. Results for any available query written by this command are final and represent the final result of the query. If VK_QUERY_RESULT_PARTIAL_BIT is set, then for any query that is unavailable, an intermediate result between zero and the final result value is written for that query. Otherwise, any result written by this command is undefined. If VK_QUERY_RESULT_64_BIT is set, results and availability or status values for all queries are written as an array of 64-bit values. If the queryPool was created with VK_QUERY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_KHR, results for each query are written as an array of the type indicated by VkPerformanceCounterKHR::storage for the counter being queried. Otherwise, results and availability or status values are written as an array of 32-bit values. If an unsigned integer query’s value overflows the result type, the value may either wrap or saturate. If the maintenance7 feature is enabled, for an unsigned integer query, the 32-bit result value must be equal to the 32 least significant bits of the equivalent 64-bit result value. If a signed integer query’s value overflows the result type, the value is undefined. If a floating-point query’s value is not representable as the result type, the value is undefined. This command defines an execution dependency between other query commands that reference the same query. The first synchronization scope includes all commands which reference the queries in queryPool indicated by query that occur earlier in submission order. If flags does not include VK_QUERY_RESULT_WAIT_BIT, vkCmdEndQueryIndexedEXT, vkCmdWriteTimestamp2, vkCmdEndQuery, and vkCmdWriteTimestamp are excluded from this scope. The second synchronization scope includes all commands which reference the queries in queryPool indicated by query that occur later in submission order. The operation of this command happens after the first scope and happens before the second scope. vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults is considered to be a transfer operation, and its writes to buffer memory must be synchronized using VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT and VK_ACCESS_TRANSFER_WRITE_BIT before using the results.

This behavior is implementation-dependent and may vary depending on the path used within an implementation. For example, some implementations have several types of clears, some of which may include vertices and some not. Occlusion queries track the number of samples that pass the per-fragment tests for a set of drawing commands. As such, occlusion queries are only available on queue families supporting graphics operations. The application can then use these results to inform future rendering decisions. An occlusion query is begun and ended by calling vkCmdBeginQuery and vkCmdEndQuery, respectively. When an occlusion query begins, the count of passing samples always starts at zero. For each drawing command, the count is incremented as described in Sample Counting. If flags does not contain VK_QUERY_CONTROL_PRECISE_BIT an implementation may generate any non-zero result value for the query if the count of passing samples is non-zero. Not setting VK_QUERY_CONTROL_PRECISE_BIT mode may be more efficient on some implementations, and should be used where it is sufficient to know a boolean result on whether any samples passed the per-fragment tests. In this case, some implementations may only return zero or one, indifferent to the actual number of samples passing the per-fragment tests. Setting VK_QUERY_CONTROL_PRECISE_BIT does not guarantee that different implementations return the same number of samples in an occlusion query. Some implementations may kill fragments in the pre-rasterization shader stage, and these killed fragments do not contribute to the final result of the query. It is possible that some implementations generate a zero result value for the query, while others generate a non-zero value. When an occlusion query finishes, the result for that query is marked as available. The application can then either copy the result to a buffer (via vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults) or request it be put into host memory (via vkGetQueryPoolResults). If occluding geometry is not drawn first, samples can pass the depth test, but still not be visible in a final image. Pipeline statistics queries allow the application to sample a specified set of VkPipeline counters. These counters are accumulated by Vulkan for a set of either drawing or dispatching commands while a pipeline statistics query is active. As such, pipeline statistics queries are available on queue families supporting either graphics or compute operations. The availability of pipeline statistics queries is indicated by the pipelineStatisticsQuery member of the VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures object (see vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures and vkCreateDevice for detecting and requesting this query type on a VkDevice). A pipeline statistics query is begun and ended by calling vkCmdBeginQuery and vkCmdEndQuery, respectively. When a pipeline statistics query begins, all statistics counters are set to zero. While the query is active, the pipeline type determines which set of statistics are available, but these must be configured on the query pool when it is created. If a statistic counter is issued on a command buffer that does not support the corresponding operation, or the counter corresponds to a shading stage which is missing from any of the pipelines used while the query is active, the value of that counter is undefined after the query has been made available. At least one statistic counter relevant to the operations supported on the recording command buffer must be enabled. Bits which can be set in VkQueryPoolCreateInfo::pipelineStatistics for query pools and in VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo::pipelineStatistics for secondary command buffers, individually enabling pipeline statistics counters, are: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef enum VkQueryPipelineStatisticFlagBits { VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_INPUT_ASSEMBLY_VERTICES_BIT = 0x00000001, VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_INPUT_ASSEMBLY_PRIMITIVES_BIT = 0x00000002, VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_VERTEX_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT = 0x00000004, VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_GEOMETRY_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT = 0x00000008, VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_GEOMETRY_SHADER_PRIMITIVES_BIT = 0x00000010, VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_INVOCATIONS_BIT = 0x00000020, VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_PRIMITIVES_BIT = 0x00000040, VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FRAGMENT_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT = 0x00000080, VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_TESSELLATION_CONTROL_SHADER_PATCHES_BIT = 0x00000100, VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_TESSELLATION_EVALUATION_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT = 0x00000200, VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_COMPUTE_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT = 0x00000400, // Provided by VK_EXT_mesh_shader VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_TASK_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT_EXT = 0x00000800, // Provided by VK_EXT_mesh_shader VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_MESH_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT_EXT = 0x00001000, // Provided by VK_HUAWEI_cluster_culling_shader VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLUSTER_CULLING_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT_HUAWEI = 0x00002000, } VkQueryPipelineStatisticFlagBits; VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_INPUT_ASSEMBLY_VERTICES_BIT specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of vertices processed by the input assembly stage. Vertices corresponding to incomplete primitives may contribute to the count. VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_INPUT_ASSEMBLY_PRIMITIVES_BIT specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives processed by the input assembly stage. If primitive restart is enabled, restarting the primitive topology has no effect on the count. Incomplete primitives may be counted. VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_VERTEX_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of vertex shader invocations. This counter’s value is incremented each time a vertex shader is invoked. VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_GEOMETRY_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of geometry shader invocations. This counter’s value is incremented each time a geometry shader is invoked. In the case of instanced geometry shaders, the geometry shader invocations count is incremented for each separate instanced invocation. VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_GEOMETRY_SHADER_PRIMITIVES_BIT specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives generated by geometry shader invocations. The counter’s value is incremented each time the geometry shader emits a primitive. Restarting primitive topology using the SPIR-V instructions OpEndPrimitive or OpEndStreamPrimitive has no effect on the geometry shader output primitives count. VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_INVOCATIONS_BIT specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives processed by the Primitive Clipping stage of the pipeline. The counter’s value is incremented each time a primitive reaches the primitive clipping stage. VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_PRIMITIVES_BIT specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives output by the Primitive Clipping stage of the pipeline. The counter’s value is incremented each time a primitive passes the primitive clipping stage. The actual number of primitives output by the primitive clipping stage for a particular input primitive is implementation-dependent but must satisfy the following conditions: If at least one vertex of the input primitive lies inside the clipping volume, the counter is incremented by one or more. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by zero or more. VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FRAGMENT_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of fragment shader invocations. The counter’s value is incremented each time the fragment shader is invoked. VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_TESSELLATION_CONTROL_SHADER_PATCHES_BIT specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of patches processed by the tessellation control shader. The counter’s value is incremented once for each patch for which a tessellation control shader is invoked. VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_TESSELLATION_EVALUATION_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of invocations of the tessellation evaluation shader. The counter’s value is incremented each time the tessellation evaluation shader is invoked. VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_COMPUTE_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of compute shader invocations. The counter’s value is incremented every time the compute shader is invoked. Implementations may skip the execution of certain compute shader invocations or execute additional compute shader invocations for implementation-dependent reasons as long as the results of rendering otherwise remain unchanged. VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_TASK_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT_EXT specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of task shader invocations. The counter’s value is incremented every time the task shader is invoked. VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_MESH_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT_EXT specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of mesh shader invocations. The counter’s value is incremented every time the mesh shader is invoked. These values are intended to measure relative statistics on one implementation. Various device architectures will count these values differently. Any or all counters may be affected by the issues described in Query Operation. This counting difference is especially true if the pipeline contains mesh or task shaders, which may affect several of the counters in unexpected ways. For example, tile-based rendering devices may need to replay the scene multiple times, affecting some of the counts. If a pipeline has rasterizerDiscardEnable enabled, implementations may discard primitives after the final pre-rasterization shader stage. As a result, if rasterizerDiscardEnable is enabled, the clipping input and output primitives counters may not be incremented. When a pipeline statistics query finishes, the result for that query is marked as available. The application can copy the result to a buffer (via vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults), or request it be put into host memory (via vkGetQueryPoolResults). // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef VkFlags VkQueryPipelineStatisticFlags; VkQueryPipelineStatisticFlags is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero or more VkQueryPipelineStatisticFlagBits. Timestamps provide applications with a mechanism for monotonically tracking the execution of commands. A timestamp is an integer value generated by the VkPhysicalDevice. Unlike other queries, timestamps do not operate over a range, and so do not use vkCmdBeginQuery or vkCmdEndQuery. The mechanism is built around a set of commands that allow the application to tell the VkPhysicalDevice to write timestamp values to a query pool and then either read timestamp values on the host (using vkGetQueryPoolResults) or copy timestamp values to a VkBuffer (using vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults). The number of valid bits in a timestamp value is determined by the VkQueueFamilyProperties::timestampValidBits property of the queue on which the timestamp is written. Timestamps are supported on any queue which reports a non-zero value for timestampValidBits via vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties. If the timestampComputeAndGraphics limit is VK_TRUE, timestamps are supported by every queue family that supports either graphics or compute operations (see VkQueueFamilyProperties). The number of nanoseconds it takes for a timestamp value to be incremented by 1 can be obtained from VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::timestampPeriod after a call to vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties. To request a timestamp and write the value to memory, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3 void vkCmdWriteTimestamp2( VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, VkPipelineStageFlags2 stage, VkQueryPool queryPool, uint32_t query); or the equivalent command // Provided by VK_KHR_synchronization2 void vkCmdWriteTimestamp2KHR( VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, VkPipelineStageFlags2 stage, VkQueryPool queryPool, uint32_t query); commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be recorded. stage specifies a stage of the pipeline. queryPool is the query pool that will manage the timestamp. query is the query within the query pool that will contain the timestamp. When vkCmdWriteTimestamp2 is submitted to a queue, it defines an execution dependency on commands that were submitted before it, and writes a timestamp to a query pool. The first synchronization scope includes all commands that occur earlier in submission order. The synchronization scope is limited to operations on the pipeline stage specified by stage. The second synchronization scope includes only the timestamp write operation. Implementations may write the timestamp at any stage that is logically later than stage. Any timestamp write that happens-after another timestamp write in the same submission must not have a lower value unless its value overflows the maximum supported integer bit width of the query. If VK_KHR_calibrated_timestamps or VK_EXT_calibrated_timestamps is enabled, this extends to timestamp writes across all submissions on the same logical device: any timestamp write that happens-after another must not have a lower value unless its value overflows the maximum supported integer bit width of the query. Timestamps written by this command must be in the VK_TIME_DOMAIN_DEVICE_KHR time domain. If an overflow occurs, the timestamp value must wrap back to zero. If vkCmdWriteTimestamp2 is called while executing a render pass instance that has multiview enabled, the timestamp uses N consecutive query indices in the query pool (starting at query) where N is the number of bits set in the view mask of the subpass or dynamic render pass the command is executed in. The resulting query values are determined by an implementation-dependent choice of one of the following behaviors: The first query is a timestamp value and (if more than one bit is set in the view mask) zero is written to the remaining queries. All N queries are timestamp values.

commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be recorded. pipelineStage is a VkPipelineStageFlagBits value, specifying a stage of the pipeline. queryPool is the query pool that will manage the timestamp. query is the query within the query pool that will contain the timestamp. When vkCmdWriteTimestamp is submitted to a queue, it defines an execution dependency on commands that were submitted before it, and writes a timestamp to a query pool. The first synchronization scope includes all commands that occur earlier in submission order. The synchronization scope is limited to operations on the pipeline stage specified by pipelineStage. The second synchronization scope includes only the timestamp write operation. Implementations may write the timestamp at any stage that is logically later than stage. Any timestamp write that happens-after another timestamp write in the same submission must not have a lower value unless its value overflows the maximum supported integer bit width of the query. If VK_KHR_calibrated_timestamps or VK_EXT_calibrated_timestamps is enabled, this extends to timestamp writes across all submissions on the same logical device: any timestamp write that happens-after another must not have a lower value unless its value overflows the maximum supported integer bit width of the query. Timestamps written by this command must be in the VK_TIME_DOMAIN_DEVICE_KHR time domain. If an overflow occurs, the timestamp value must wrap back to zero. If vkCmdWriteTimestamp is called while executing a render pass instance that has multiview enabled, the timestamp uses N consecutive query indices in the query pool (starting at query) where N is the number of bits set in the view mask of the subpass or dynamic render pass the command is executed in. The resulting query values are determined by an implementation-dependent choice of one of the following behaviors: The first query is a timestamp value and (if more than one bit is set in the view mask) zero is written to the remaining queries. All N queries are timestamp values. Either way, if two timestamps are written in the same subpass or dynamic render pass with multiview enabled, each of the N consecutive queries written for a timestamp must not have a lower value than the queries with corresponding indices written by the timestamp that happens-before unless the value overflows the maximum supported integer bit width of the query.

Each queue family advertises the performance counters that can be queried on a queue of that family via a call to vkEnumeratePhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyPerformanceQueryCountersKHR. Implementations may limit access to performance counters based on platform requirements or only to specialized drivers for development purposes. This may include no performance counters being enumerated, or a reduced set. Please refer to platform-specific documentation for guidance on any such restrictions. Performance queries use the existing vkCmdBeginQuery and vkCmdEndQuery to control what command buffers, render passes, or commands to get performance information for. Implementations may require multiple passes where the command buffer, render passes, or commands being recorded are the same and are executed on the same queue to record performance counter data. This is achieved by submitting the same batch and providing a VkPerformanceQuerySubmitInfoKHR structure containing a counter pass index. The number of passes required for a given performance query pool can be queried via a call to vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyPerformanceQueryPassesKHR. Command buffers created with VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_ONE_TIME_SUBMIT_BIT must not be re-submitted. Changing command buffer usage bits may affect performance. To avoid this, the application should re-record any command buffers with the VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_ONE_TIME_SUBMIT_BIT when multiple counter passes are required. Performance counter results from a performance query pool can be obtained with the command vkGetQueryPoolResults. The VkPerformanceCounterResultKHR union is defined as: // Provided by VK_KHR_performance_query typedef union VkPerformanceCounterResultKHR { int32_t int32; int64_t int64; uint32_t uint32; uint64_t uint64; float float32; double float64; } VkPerformanceCounterResultKHR; int32 is a 32-bit signed integer value. int64 is a 64-bit signed integer value. uint32 is a 32-bit unsigned integer value. uint64 is a 64-bit unsigned integer value. float32 is a 32-bit floating-point value. float64 is a 64-bit floating-point value. Performance query results are returned in an array of VkPerformanceCounterResultKHR unions containing the data associated with each counter in the query, stored in the same order as the counters supplied in pCounterIndices when creating the performance query. VkPerformanceCounterKHR::storage specifies how to parse the counter data. To record and submit a command buffer containing a performance query pool the profiling lock must be held. The profiling lock must be acquired prior to any call to vkBeginCommandBuffer that will be using a performance query pool. The profiling lock must be held while any command buffer containing a performance query pool is in the recording, executable, or pending state. To acquire the profiling lock, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_performance_query VkResult vkAcquireProfilingLockKHR( VkDevice device, const VkAcquireProfilingLockInfoKHR* pInfo); device is the logical device to profile. pInfo is a pointer to a VkAcquireProfilingLockInfoKHR structure containing information about how the profiling is to be acquired. Implementations may allow multiple actors to hold the profiling lock concurrently.

This query is updated during drawing commands while transform feedback is active. The number of primitives actually written will be less than the number attempted to be written if the bound transform feedback buffer size was too small for the number of primitives actually drawn. Primitives are not written beyond the bound range of the transform feedback buffer. A transform feedback query is begun and ended by calling vkCmdBeginQuery and vkCmdEndQuery, respectively to query for vertex stream zero. vkCmdBeginQueryIndexedEXT and vkCmdEndQueryIndexedEXT can be used to begin and end transform feedback queries for any supported vertex stream. When a transform feedback query begins, the count of primitives written and primitives needed starts from zero. For each drawing command, the count is incremented as vertex attribute outputs are captured to the transform feedback buffers while transform feedback is active. When a transform feedback query finishes, the result for that query is marked as available. The application can then either copy the result to a buffer (via vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults) or request it be put into host memory (via vkGetQueryPoolResults). When a generated primitive query for a vertex stream is active, the primitives-generated count is incremented every time a primitive emitted to that stream reaches the transform feedback stage, whether or not transform feedback is active. A primitives generated query is begun and ended by calling vkCmdBeginQuery and vkCmdEndQuery, respectively to query for vertex stream zero. vkCmdBeginQueryIndexedEXT and vkCmdEndQueryIndexedEXT can be used to begin and end primitives generated queries for any supported vertex stream. When a primitives generated query begins, the count of primitives generated starts from zero. When a primitives generated query finishes, the result for that query is marked as available. The application can then either copy the result to a buffer (via vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults) or request it be put into host memory (via vkGetQueryPoolResults). The result of this query is typically identical to VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_INVOCATIONS_BIT, but the primitives generated query is deterministic, i.e. it must be identical to the number of primitives processed. VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_INVOCATIONS_BIT may vary for implementation-dependent reasons, e.g. the same primitive may be processed multiple times for purposes of clipping. When a generated mesh primitives query is active, the mesh-primitives-generated count is incremented every time a primitive emitted from the mesh shader stage reaches the fragment shader stage. When a generated mesh primitives query begins, the mesh-primitives-generated count starts from zero. Mesh and task shader pipeline statistics queries function the same way that invocation queries work for other shader stages, counting the number of times the respective shader stage has been run. When the statistics query begins, the invocation counters start from zero. Intel performance queries allow an application to capture performance data for a set of commands. Performance queries are used in a similar way than other types of queries. A main difference with existing queries is that the resulting data should be handed over to a library capable to produce human readable results rather than being read directly by an application.

Unlike other query types, result status queries do not track or maintain any other data beyond the completion status, thus no other data is written when retrieving their results. Support for result status queries is indicated by VkQueueFamilyQueryResultStatusPropertiesKHR::queryResultStatusSupport , as returned by vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties2 for the queue family in question. Video encode feedback queries allow the application to capture feedback values generated by video encode operations. As such, video encode feedback queries are available on queue families supporting video encode operations. The availability of individual video encode feedback values is indicated by the bits of VkVideoEncodeCapabilitiesKHR::supportedEncodeFeedbackFlags, as returned by vkGetPhysicalDeviceVideoCapabilitiesKHR for the video profile the queries are intended to be used with. The set of enabled video encode feedback values must be configured on the query pool when it is created using the encodeFeedbackFlags member of the VkQueryPoolVideoEncodeFeedbackCreateInfoKHR included in the pNext chain of VkQueryPoolCreateInfo. The VkQueryPoolVideoEncodeFeedbackCreateInfoKHR structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_KHR_video_encode_queue typedef struct VkQueryPoolVideoEncodeFeedbackCreateInfoKHR { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; VkVideoEncodeFeedbackFlagsKHR encodeFeedbackFlags; } VkQueryPoolVideoEncodeFeedbackCreateInfoKHR; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. encodeFeedbackFlags is a bitmask of VkVideoEncodeFeedbackFlagBitsKHR values specifying the set of enabled video encode feedback values captured by queries of the new pool.

For the first video encode operation issued by any video encode command, this value will always be zero, meaning that bitstream data is always written to the buffer specified in VkVideoEncodeInfoKHR::dstBuffer starting from the offset specified in VkVideoEncodeInfoKHR::dstBufferOffset. VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_FEEDBACK_BITSTREAM_BYTES_WRITTEN_BIT_KHR specifies that queries managed by the pool will capture the number of bytes written by the video encode operation to the bitstream buffer specified in VkVideoEncodeInfoKHR::dstBuffer. VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_FEEDBACK_BITSTREAM_HAS_OVERRIDES_BIT_KHR specifies that queries managed by the pool will capture a boolean value indicating that the data written to the bitstream buffer specified in VkVideoEncodeInfoKHR::dstBuffer contains overridden parameters. When retrieving the results of video encode feedback queries, the values corresponding to each enabled video encode feedback are written in the order of the bits defined above, followed by an optional value indicating availability or result status if VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_AVAILABILITY_BIT or VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_STATUS_BIT_KHR is specified, respectively. If the result status of a video encode feedback query is negative, then the results of all enabled video encode feedback values will be undefined. Applications should always specify VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_STATUS_BIT_KHR when retrieving the results of video encode feedback queries and ignore such undefined video encode feedback values for any unsuccessfully completed video encode operations. // Provided by VK_KHR_video_encode_queue typedef VkFlags VkVideoEncodeFeedbackFlagsKHR; VkVideoEncodeFeedbackFlagsKHR is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero or more VkVideoEncodeFeedbackFlagBitsKHR.
