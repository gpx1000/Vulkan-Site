## Content

A *descriptor* is an opaque data structure representing a shader resource
such as a buffer, buffer view, image view, sampler, or combined image
sampler.
Descriptors are organized into *descriptor sets*, which are bound during
command recording for use in subsequent drawing commands.
The arrangement of content in each descriptor set is determined by a
*descriptor set layout*, which determines what descriptors can be stored
within it.
The sequence of descriptor set layouts that **can** be used by a pipeline is
specified in a *pipeline layout*.
Each pipeline object **can** use up to `maxBoundDescriptorSets` (see
[Limits](limits.html#limits)) descriptor sets.

If the [`descriptorBuffer`](features.html#features-descriptorBuffer) feature is
enabled, the implementation supports placing descriptors into
[descriptor buffers](#descriptorbuffers) which are bound during command
recording in a similar way to descriptor sets.

Shaders access resources via variables decorated with a descriptor set and
binding number that link them to a descriptor in a descriptor set.
The shader interface mapping to bound descriptor sets is described in the
[Shader Resource Interface](interfaces.html#interfaces-resources) section.

Shaders **can** also access buffers without going through descriptors by using
[Physical Storage Buffer Access](#descriptorsets-physical-storage-buffer) to
access them through 64-bit addresses.

There are a number of different types of descriptor supported by Vulkan,
corresponding to different resources or usage.
The following sections describe the API definitions of each descriptor type.
The mapping of each type to SPIR-V is listed in the
[Shader Resource and Descriptor Type Correspondence](interfaces.html#interfaces-resources-correspondence) and [Shader Resource and Storage Class Correspondence](interfaces.html#interfaces-resources-storage-class-correspondence) tables in the
[Shader Interfaces](interfaces.html#interfaces) chapter.

A *storage image* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_IMAGE`) is a descriptor
type associated with an [image resource](resources.html#resources-images) via an
[image view](resources.html#resources-image-views) that load, store, and atomic
operations **can** be performed on.

Storage image loads are supported in all shader stages for image views whose
[format features](resources.html#resources-image-view-format-features) contain
[`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_BIT`](formats.html#formats-properties).

Stores to storage images are supported in
task, mesh and
compute shaders for image views whose
[format features](resources.html#resources-image-view-format-features) contain
[`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_BIT`](formats.html#formats-properties).

Atomic operations on storage images are supported in
task, mesh and
compute shaders for image views whose
[format features](resources.html#resources-image-view-format-features) contain
[`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_ATOMIC_BIT`](formats.html#formats-properties).

When the [`fragmentStoresAndAtomics`](features.html#features-fragmentStoresAndAtomics) feature is enabled, stores and atomic
operations are also supported for storage images in fragment shaders with
the same set of image formats as supported in compute shaders.
When the [`vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics`](features.html#features-vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics) feature is enabled, stores and atomic
operations are also supported in vertex, tessellation, and geometry shaders
with the same set of image formats as supported in compute shaders.

The image subresources for a storage image **must** be in the
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHARED_PRESENT_KHR` or
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL` layout in order to access its data in a
shader.

When the [`tileShadingColorAttachments`](features.html#features-tileShadingColorAttachments) feature is enabled, loads using
`OpImageRead` or `OpImageSparseRead` are supported for color
[tile attachments](interfaces.html#interfaces-tile-attachment) in fragment and compute
shaders for image views whose [format features](resources.html#resources-image-view-format-features) contain [`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_BIT`](formats.html#formats-properties).
Additionally, when [`tileShadingColorAttachments`](features.html#features-tileShadingColorAttachments) is enabled, stores using
`OpImageWrite` are supported for color attachments in compute shaders
with the same set of image formats as for loads.
When the [`tileShadingAtomicOps`](features.html#features-tileShadingAtomicOps) is
enabled, tile atomic operations are supported for color attachments in
compute shaders with the same set of image formats as for loads.

When the [`tileShadingInputAttachments`](features.html#features-tileShadingInputAttachments) feature is enabled, loads using
`OpImageRead` are supported for input [tile attachments](interfaces.html#interfaces-tile-attachment) in fragment and compute shaders with the same set of image
formats as for color attachments.
Stores to input attachments are not supported.

When the [`tileShadingDepthAttachments`](features.html#features-tileShadingDepthAttachments) or
[`tileShadingStencilAttachments`](features.html#features-tileShadingStencilAttachments) feature is enabled, loads using
`OpImageRead` or `OpImageSparseRead` are supported for depth or
stencil aspects of a depth/stencil [tile attachment](interfaces.html#interfaces-tile-attachment) in fragment and compute shaders with the same set of image
formats as for color attachments.
Stores to depth/stencil attachments are not supported.

A *sampler descriptor* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLER`) is a descriptor
type associated with a [sampler](samplers.html#samplers) object, used to control the
behavior of [sampling operations](textures.html#textures) performed on a
[sampled image](#descriptorsets-sampledimage).

A *sampled image* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLED_IMAGE`) is a descriptor
type associated with an [image resource](resources.html#resources-images) via an
[image view](resources.html#resources-image-views) that [sampling operations](textures.html#textures)
**can** be performed on.

Shaders combine a sampled image variable and a sampler variable to perform
sampling operations.

Sampled images are supported in all shader stages for image views whose
[format features](resources.html#resources-image-view-format-features) contain
[`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT`](formats.html#formats-properties).

An image subresources for a sampled image **must** be in one of the following
layouts:

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHARED_PRESENT_KHR`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_READ_ONLY_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL_KHR`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT`

A *combined image sampler* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER`)
is a single descriptor type associated with both a [sampler](samplers.html#samplers) and
an [image resource](resources.html#resources-images), combining both a
[sampler](#descriptorsets-sampler) and [sampled image](#descriptorsets-sampledimage) descriptor into a single descriptor.

If the descriptor refers to a sampler that performs
[Y′CBCR conversion](samplers.html#samplers-YCbCr-conversion) or samples a
[subsampled image](samplers.html#samplers-subsamplesampler),
the sampler **must** only be used to sample the image in the same descriptor.
Otherwise, the
sampler and image in this type of descriptor **can** be used freely with any
other samplers and images.

An image subresources for a combined image sampler **must** be in one of the
following layouts:

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHARED_PRESENT_KHR`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_READ_ONLY_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL_KHR`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT`

|  | On some implementations, it **may** be more efficient to sample from an image
| --- | --- |
using a combination of sampler and sampled image that are stored together in
the descriptor set in a combined descriptor. |

A *uniform texel buffer* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER`) is
a descriptor type associated with a [buffer resource](resources.html#resources-buffers)
via a [buffer view](resources.html#resources-buffer-views) that [image sampling operations](textures.html#textures) **can** be performed on.

Uniform texel buffers define a tightly-packed 1-dimensional linear array of
texels, with texels going through format conversion when read in a shader in
the same way as they are for an image.

Load operations from uniform texel buffers are supported in all shader
stages for buffer view formats which report
[format features](resources.html#resources-buffer-view-format-features) support for
`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER_BIT`

A *storage texel buffer* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER`) is
a descriptor type associated with a [buffer resource](resources.html#resources-buffers)
via a [buffer view](resources.html#resources-buffer-views) that [image load, store, and atomic operations](textures.html#textures) **can** be performed on.

Storage texel buffers define a tightly-packed 1-dimensional linear array of
texels, with texels going through format conversion when read in a shader in
the same way as they are for an image.
Unlike [uniform texel buffers](#descriptorsets-uniformtexelbuffer), these
buffers can also be written to in the same way as for
[storage images](#descriptorsets-storageimage).

Storage texel buffer loads are supported in all shader stages for texel
buffer view formats which report
[format features](resources.html#resources-buffer-view-format-features) support for
`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER_BIT`

Stores to storage texel buffers are supported in
task, mesh and
compute shaders for texel buffer formats which report
[format features](resources.html#resources-buffer-view-format-features) support for
`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER_BIT`

Atomic operations on storage texel buffers are supported in
task, mesh and
compute shaders for texel buffer formats which report
[format features](resources.html#resources-buffer-view-format-features) support for
`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER_ATOMIC_BIT`

When the [`fragmentStoresAndAtomics`](features.html#features-fragmentStoresAndAtomics) feature is enabled, stores and atomic
operations are also supported for storage texel buffers in fragment shaders
with the same set of texel buffer formats as supported in compute shaders.
When the [`vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics`](features.html#features-vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics) feature is enabled, stores and atomic
operations are also supported in vertex, tessellation, and geometry shaders
with the same set of texel buffer formats as supported in compute shaders.

A *storage buffer* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER`) is a descriptor
type associated with a [buffer resource](resources.html#resources-buffers) directly,
described in a shader as a structure with various members that load, store,
and atomic operations **can** be performed on.

|  | Atomic operations **can** only be performed on members of certain types as
| --- | --- |
defined in the [SPIR-V environment appendix](../appendices/spirvenv.html#spirvenv). |

A *uniform buffer* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER`) is a descriptor
type associated with a [buffer resource](resources.html#resources-buffers) directly,
described in a shader as a structure with various members that load
operations **can** be performed on.

A *dynamic uniform buffer* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC`)
is almost identical to a [uniform buffer](#descriptorsets-uniformbuffer),
and differs only in how the offset into the buffer is specified.
The base offset calculated by the [VkDescriptorBufferInfo](#VkDescriptorBufferInfo) when
initially [updating the descriptor set](#descriptorsets-updates) is added
to a [dynamic offset](#descriptorsets-binding-dynamicoffsets) when binding
the descriptor set.

A *dynamic storage buffer* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER_DYNAMIC`)
is almost identical to a [storage buffer](#descriptorsets-storagebuffer),
and differs only in how the offset into the buffer is specified.
The base offset calculated by the [VkDescriptorBufferInfo](#VkDescriptorBufferInfo) when
initially [updating the descriptor set](#descriptorsets-updates) is added
to a [dynamic offset](#descriptorsets-binding-dynamicoffsets) when binding
the descriptor set.

An *inline uniform block* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK`) is
almost identical to a [uniform buffer](#descriptorsets-uniformbuffer), and
differs only in taking its storage directly from the encompassing descriptor
set instead of being backed by buffer memory.
It is typically used to access a small set of constant data that does not
require the additional flexibility provided by the indirection enabled when
using a uniform buffer where the descriptor and the referenced buffer memory
are decoupled.
Compared to push constants, they allow reusing the same set of constant data
across multiple disjoint sets of drawing and dispatching commands.

Inline uniform block descriptors **cannot** be aggregated into arrays.
Instead, the array size specified for an inline uniform block descriptor
binding specifies the binding’s capacity in bytes.

A *sample weight image* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_IMAGE_QCOM`)
is a descriptor type associated with an [image resource](resources.html#resources-images)
via an [image view](resources.html#resources-image-views) that **can** be used in
[weight image sampling](textures.html#textures-weightimage).
The image view **must** have been created with
[VkImageViewSampleWeightCreateInfoQCOM](resources.html#VkImageViewSampleWeightCreateInfoQCOM).

Shaders **can** combine a weight image variable, a sampled image variable, and
a sampler variable to perform [weight image sampling](textures.html#textures-weightimage).

Weight image sampling is supported in all shader stages if the weight image
view specifies a format that supports
[format feature](resources.html#resources-image-view-format-features)
[`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_2_WEIGHT_IMAGE_BIT_QCOM`](formats.html#formats-properties) and
the sampled image view specifies a format that supports
[format feature](resources.html#resources-image-view-format-features)
[`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_2_WEIGHT_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT_QCOM`](formats.html#formats-properties)

The image subresources for the weight image **must** be in the
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`, or
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL` layout in order to access its data in a
shader.

A *block matching image* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_BLOCK_MATCH_IMAGE_QCOM`)
is a descriptor type associated with an [image resource](resources.html#resources-images)
via an [image view](resources.html#resources-image-views) that **can** be used in
[block matching](textures.html#textures-blockmatch).

Shaders **can** combine a target image variable, a reference image variable,
and a sampler variable to perform [block matching](textures.html#textures-blockmatch).

Block matching is supported in all shader stages for if both the target view
and reference view specifies a format that supports
[format feature](resources.html#resources-image-view-format-features)
[`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_2_BLOCK_MATCHING_BIT_QCOM`](formats.html#formats-properties)

The image subresources for block matching **must** be in the
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`, or
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL` layout in order to access its data in a
shader.

An *input attachment* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT`) is a
descriptor type associated with an [image resource](resources.html#resources-images) via
an [image view](resources.html#resources-image-views) that **can** be used for
[framebuffer local](synchronization.html#synchronization-framebuffer-regions) load operations in
fragment shaders.

All image formats that are supported for color attachments
(`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT`
or `VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_2_LINEAR_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT_NV`
) or depth/stencil attachments
(`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT`) for a given image
tiling mode are also supported for input attachments.

An image view used as an input attachment **must** be in one of the following
layouts:

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHARED_PRESENT_KHR`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_READ_ONLY_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL_KHR`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_RENDERING_LOCAL_READ`

An *acceleration structure* (
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_KHR`
or
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_NV`
) is a descriptor type that is used to retrieve scene geometry from within
shaders that are used for ray traversal.
Shaders have read-only access to the memory.

A descriptor of *mutable* (`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT`) type
indicates that this descriptor **can** mutate to any of the descriptor types
given in the [VkMutableDescriptorTypeListEXT](#VkMutableDescriptorTypeListEXT)::`pDescriptorTypes`
list of descriptor types in the `pNext` chain of
[VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo) for this binding.
At any point, each individual descriptor of mutable type has an active
descriptor type.
The active descriptor type **can** be any one of the declared types in
`pDescriptorTypes`.
Additionally, a mutable descriptor’s active descriptor type **can** be of the
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT` type, which is the initial active
descriptor type.
The active descriptor type **can** change when the descriptor is updated.
When a descriptor is consumed by binding a descriptor set, the active
descriptor type is considered, not `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT`.

An active descriptor type of `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT` is
considered an **undefined** descriptor.
If a descriptor is consumed where the active descriptor type does not match
what the shader expects, the descriptor is considered an **undefined**
descriptor.

|  | To find which descriptor types are supported as
| --- | --- |
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT`, the application **can** use
[vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutSupport](#vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutSupport) with a
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT` binding, with the list of descriptor
types to query in the
[VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoEXT](#VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoEXT)::`pMutableDescriptorTypeLists`
array for that binding. |

|  | The intention of a mutable descriptor type is that implementations allocate
| --- | --- |
N bytes per descriptor, where N is determined by the maximum descriptor size
for a given descriptor binding.
Implementations are not expected to keep track of the active descriptor
type, and it should be considered a C-like union type.

A mutable descriptor type is not considered as efficient in terms of runtime
performance as using a non-mutable descriptor type, and applications are not
encouraged to use them outside API layering efforts.
Mutable descriptor types can be more efficient if the alternative is using
many different descriptors to emulate mutable descriptor types. |

Descriptors are grouped together into descriptor set objects.
A descriptor set object is an opaque object containing storage for a set of
descriptors, where the types and number of descriptors is defined by a
descriptor set layout.
The layout object **may** be used to define the association of each descriptor
binding with memory or other implementation resources.
The layout is used both for determining the resources that need to be
associated with the descriptor set, and determining the interface between
shader stages and shader resources.

A descriptor set layout object is defined by an array of zero or more
descriptor bindings.
Each individual descriptor binding is specified by a descriptor type, a
count (array size) of the number of descriptors in the binding, a set of
shader stages that **can** access the binding, and (if using immutable
samplers) an array of sampler descriptors.

Descriptor set layout objects are represented by `VkDescriptorSetLayout`
handles:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkDescriptorSetLayout)

To create descriptor set layout objects, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0

    const VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo*      pCreateInfo,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator,
    VkDescriptorSetLayout*                      pSetLayout);

* 
`device` is the logical device that creates the descriptor set
layout.

`pCreateInfo` is a pointer to a
[VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo) structure specifying the state of
the descriptor set layout object.

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_SET_LAYOUT_CREATE_PUSH_DESCRIPTOR_BIT` specifies that
descriptor sets **must** not be allocated using this layout, and
descriptors are instead pushed by [vkCmdPushDescriptorSet](#vkCmdPushDescriptorSet).

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_SET_LAYOUT_CREATE_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_POOL_BIT`
specifies that descriptor sets using this layout **must** be allocated from
a descriptor pool created with the
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_POOL_CREATE_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT` bit set.
Descriptor set layouts created with this bit set have alternate limits
for the maximum number of descriptors per-stage and per-pipeline layout.
The non-UpdateAfterBind limits only count descriptors in sets created
without this flag.
The UpdateAfterBind limits count all descriptors, but the limits **may** be
higher than the non-UpdateAfterBind limits.

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_SET_LAYOUT_CREATE_INDIRECT_BINDABLE_BIT_NV` specifies
that descriptor sets using this layout allows them to be bound with
compute pipelines that are created with
`VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_INDIRECT_BINDABLE_BIT_NV` flag set to be used in
[Device-Generated Commands](device_generated_commands/generatedcommands.html#device-generated-commands).

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_SET_LAYOUT_CREATE_DESCRIPTOR_BUFFER_BIT_EXT`
specifies that this layout **must** only be used with descriptor buffers.

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_SET_LAYOUT_CREATE_EMBEDDED_IMMUTABLE_SAMPLERS_BIT_EXT`
specifies that this is a layout only containing immutable samplers that
**can** be bound by [vkCmdBindDescriptorBufferEmbeddedSamplersEXT](#vkCmdBindDescriptorBufferEmbeddedSamplersEXT).
Unlike normal immutable samplers, embedded immutable samplers do not
require the application to provide them in a descriptor buffer.

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_SET_LAYOUT_CREATE_HOST_ONLY_POOL_BIT_EXT` specifies
that descriptor sets using this layout **must** be allocated from a
descriptor pool created with the
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_POOL_CREATE_HOST_ONLY_BIT_EXT` bit set.
Descriptor set layouts created with this bit have no expressible limit
for maximum number of descriptors per-stage.
Host descriptor sets are limited only by available host memory, but **may**
be limited for implementation specific reasons.
Implementations **may** limit the number of supported descriptors to
UpdateAfterBind limits or non-UpdateAfterBind limits, whichever is
larger.

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_SET_LAYOUT_CREATE_PER_STAGE_BIT_NV` specifies that
binding numbers in descriptor sets using this layout **may** represent
different resources and/or types of resources in each stage.

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef VkFlags VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateFlags;

`VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateFlags` is a bitmask type for setting a mask
of zero or more [VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateFlagBits](#VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateFlagBits).

The `VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding {
    uint32_t              binding;
    VkDescriptorType      descriptorType;
    uint32_t              descriptorCount;
    VkShaderStageFlags    stageFlags;
    const VkSampler*      pImmutableSamplers;
} VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding;

* 
`binding` is the binding number of this entry and corresponds to a
resource of the same binding number in the shader stages.

* 
`descriptorType` is a [VkDescriptorType](#VkDescriptorType) specifying which type
of resource descriptors are used for this binding.

* 
`descriptorCount` is the number of descriptors contained in the
binding, accessed in a shader as an
array, except if `descriptorType` is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK` in which case
`descriptorCount` is the size in bytes of the inline uniform block.
If `descriptorCount` is zero this binding entry is reserved and the
resource **must** not be accessed from any stage via this binding within
any pipeline using the set layout.

* 
`stageFlags` member is a bitmask of [VkShaderStageFlagBits](pipelines.html#VkShaderStageFlagBits)
specifying which pipeline shader stages **can** access a resource for this
binding.
`VK_SHADER_STAGE_ALL` is a shorthand specifying that all defined
shader stages, including any additional stages defined by extensions,
**can** access the resource.

If a shader stage is not included in `stageFlags`, then a resource **must**
not be accessed from that stage via this binding within any pipeline using
the set layout.
Other than input attachments which are limited to the fragment shader, there
are no limitations on what combinations of stages **can** use a descriptor
binding, and in particular a binding **can** be used by both graphics stages
and the compute stage.

* 
`pImmutableSamplers` affects initialization of samplers.
If `descriptorType` specifies a `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLER` or
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER` type descriptor, then
`pImmutableSamplers` **can** be used to initialize a set of *immutable
samplers*.
Immutable samplers are permanently bound into the set layout and **must**
not be changed; updating a `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLER` descriptor
with immutable samplers is not allowed and updates to a
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER` descriptor with
immutable samplers does not modify the samplers (the image views are
updated, but the sampler updates are ignored).
If `pImmutableSamplers` is not `NULL`, then it is a pointer to an
array of sampler handles that will be copied into the set layout and
used for the corresponding binding.
Only the sampler handles are copied; the sampler objects **must** not be
destroyed before the final use of the set layout and any descriptor
pools and sets created using it.
If `pImmutableSamplers` is `NULL`, then the sampler slots are
dynamic and sampler handles **must** be bound into descriptor sets using
this layout.
If `descriptorType` is not one of these descriptor types, then
`pImmutableSamplers` is ignored.

The above layout definition allows the descriptor bindings to be specified
sparsely such that not all binding numbers between 0 and the maximum binding
number need to be specified in the `pBindings` array.
Bindings that are not specified have a `descriptorCount` and
`stageFlags` of zero, and the value of `descriptorType` is
**undefined**.
However, all binding numbers between 0 and the maximum binding number in the
[VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo)::`pBindings` array **may** consume
memory in the descriptor set layout even if not all descriptor bindings are
used, though it **should** not consume additional memory from the descriptor
pool.

|  | The maximum binding number specified **should** be as compact as possible to
| --- | --- |
avoid wasted memory. |

Bits which **can** be set in each element of

specifying options for the corresponding descriptor set layout binding, are:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2
typedef enum VkDescriptorBindingFlagBits {
    VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT = 0x00000001,
    VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_UNUSED_WHILE_PENDING_BIT = 0x00000002,

  // Provided by VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing
    VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_VARIABLE_DESCRIPTOR_COUNT_BIT_EXT = VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_VARIABLE_DESCRIPTOR_COUNT_BIT,
} VkDescriptorBindingFlagBits;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing
typedef VkDescriptorBindingFlagBits VkDescriptorBindingFlagBitsEXT;

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT` specifies that if
descriptors in this binding are updated between when the descriptor set
is bound in a command buffer and when that command buffer is submitted
to a queue, then the submission will use the most recently set
descriptors for this binding and the updates do not invalidate the
command buffer.
Descriptor bindings created with this flag are also partially exempt
from the external synchronization requirement in
[vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplateKHR](#vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplateKHR) and
[vkUpdateDescriptorSets](#vkUpdateDescriptorSets).
Multiple descriptors with this flag set **can** be updated concurrently in
different threads, though the same descriptor **must** not be updated
concurrently by two threads.
Descriptors with this flag set **can** be updated concurrently with the set
being bound to a command buffer in another thread, but not concurrently
with the set being reset or freed.

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_PARTIALLY_BOUND_BIT` specifies that
descriptors in this binding that are not *dynamically used* need not
contain valid descriptors at the time the descriptors are consumed.
A descriptor is dynamically used if any shader invocation executes an
instruction that performs any memory access using the descriptor.
If a descriptor is not dynamically used, any resource referenced by the
descriptor is not considered to be referenced during command execution.

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_UNUSED_WHILE_PENDING_BIT` specifies
that descriptors in this binding **can** be updated after a command buffer
has bound this descriptor set, or while a command buffer that uses this
descriptor set is pending execution, as long as the descriptors that are
updated are not used by those command buffers.
Descriptor bindings created with this flag are also partially exempt
from the external synchronization requirement in
[vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplateKHR](#vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplateKHR) and
[vkUpdateDescriptorSets](#vkUpdateDescriptorSets) in the same way as for
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT`.
If `VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_PARTIALLY_BOUND_BIT` is also set, then
descriptors **can** be updated as long as they are not dynamically used by
any shader invocations.
If `VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_PARTIALLY_BOUND_BIT` is not set, then
descriptors **can** be updated as long as they are not statically used by
any shader invocations.

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_VARIABLE_DESCRIPTOR_COUNT_BIT` specifies that
    this is a *variable-sized descriptor binding* whose size will be
    specified when a descriptor set is allocated using this layout.
    The value of `descriptorCount` is treated as an upper bound on the
    size of the binding.
    This **must** only be used for the last binding in the descriptor set
    layout (i.e. the binding with the largest value of `binding`).
    For the purposes of counting against limits such as
    `maxDescriptorSet`* and `maxPerStageDescriptor`*, the full value
    of `descriptorCount` is
    counted, except for descriptor bindings with a descriptor type of
    `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK`, when
    [VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo)::`flags` does not contain
    `VK_DESCRIPTOR_SET_LAYOUT_CREATE_DESCRIPTOR_BUFFER_BIT_EXT`.
    In this case, `descriptorCount` specifies the upper bound on the
    byte size of the binding; thus it counts against the
[`maxInlineUniformBlockSize`](devsandqueues.html#limits-maxInlineUniformBlockSize) and [`maxInlineUniformTotalSize`](devsandqueues.html#limits-maxInlineUniformTotalSize) limits
instead.

|  | Note that while `VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT` and
| --- | --- |
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_UNUSED_WHILE_PENDING_BIT` both involve
updates to descriptor sets after they are bound,
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_UNUSED_WHILE_PENDING_BIT` is a weaker
requirement since it is only about descriptors that are not used, whereas
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT` requires the
implementation to observe updates to descriptors that are used. |

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2
typedef VkFlags VkDescriptorBindingFlags;

// Provided by VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing
typedef VkDescriptorBindingFlags VkDescriptorBindingFlagsEXT;

`VkDescriptorBindingFlags` is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero
or more [VkDescriptorBindingFlagBits](#VkDescriptorBindingFlagBits).

To query information about whether a descriptor set layout **can** be created,
call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
void vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutSupport(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo*      pCreateInfo,
    VkDescriptorSetLayoutSupport*               pSupport);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance3
void vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutSupportKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo*      pCreateInfo,
    VkDescriptorSetLayoutSupport*               pSupport);

* 
`device` is the logical device that would create the descriptor set
layout.

* 
`pCreateInfo` is a pointer to a
[VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo) structure specifying the state of
the descriptor set layout object.

* 
`pSupport` is a pointer to a [VkDescriptorSetLayoutSupport](#VkDescriptorSetLayoutSupport)
structure, in which information about support for the descriptor set
layout object is returned.

Some implementations have limitations on what fits in a descriptor set which
are not easily expressible in terms of existing limits like
`maxDescriptorSet`*, for example if all descriptor types share a limited
space in memory but each descriptor is a different size or alignment.
This command returns information about whether a descriptor set satisfies
this limit.
If the descriptor set layout satisfies the
[VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance3Properties](limits.html#VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance3Properties)::`maxPerSetDescriptors`
limit, this command is guaranteed to return `VK_TRUE` in
[VkDescriptorSetLayoutSupport](#VkDescriptorSetLayoutSupport)::`supported`.
If the descriptor set layout exceeds the
[VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance3Properties](limits.html#VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance3Properties)::`maxPerSetDescriptors`
limit, whether the descriptor set layout is supported is
implementation-dependent and **may** depend on whether the descriptor sizes and
alignments cause the layout to exceed an internal limit.

This command does not consider other limits such as
`maxPerStageDescriptor`*, and so a descriptor set layout that is
supported according to this command **must** still satisfy the pipeline layout
limits such as `maxPerStageDescriptor`* in order to be used in a
pipeline layout.

|  | This is a `VkDevice` query rather than `VkPhysicalDevice` because
| --- | --- |
the answer **may** depend on enabled features. |

typedef struct VkDescriptorSetLayoutSupport {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;

[](#VUID-VkDescriptorSetLayoutSupport-sType-unique) VUID-VkDescriptorSetLayoutSupport-sType-unique

 The `sType` value of each structure in the `pNext` chain **must** be unique

If the `pNext` chain of a [VkDescriptorSetLayoutSupport](#VkDescriptorSetLayoutSupport) structure
includes a `VkDescriptorSetVariableDescriptorCountLayoutSupport`
structure, then that structure returns additional information about whether
the descriptor set layout is supported.

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2
typedef struct VkDescriptorSetVariableDescriptorCountLayoutSupport {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    uint32_t           maxVariableDescriptorCount;
} VkDescriptorSetVariableDescriptorCountLayoutSupport;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing
typedef VkDescriptorSetVariableDescriptorCountLayoutSupport VkDescriptorSetVariableDescriptorCountLayoutSupportEXT;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`maxVariableDescriptorCount` indicates the maximum number of
descriptors supported in the highest numbered binding of the layout, if
that binding is variable-sized.
If the highest numbered binding of the layout has a descriptor type of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK` then
`maxVariableDescriptorCount` indicates the maximum byte size
supported for the binding, if that binding is variable-sized.

If the [VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo) structure specified in
[vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutSupport](#vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutSupport)::`pCreateInfo` includes a
variable-sized descriptor, then `supported` is determined assuming the
requested size of the variable-sized descriptor, and
`maxVariableDescriptorCount` is the maximum size of that descriptor that
**can** be successfully created (which is greater than or equal to the
requested size passed in).
If the [VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo) structure does not include a
variable-sized descriptor, or if the
[VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorIndexingFeatures](features.html#VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorIndexingFeatures)::`descriptorBindingVariableDescriptorCount`
feature is not enabled, then `maxVariableDescriptorCount` is zero.
For the purposes of this command, a variable-sized descriptor binding with a
`descriptorCount` of zero is treated as having a `descriptorCount`
of
four if `descriptorType` is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK`, or one otherwise,
and thus the binding is not ignored and the maximum descriptor count will be
returned.
If the layout is not supported, then the value written to
`maxVariableDescriptorCount` is **undefined**.

Host Synchronization

* 
Host access to `descriptorSetLayout` **must** be externally synchronized

Access to descriptor sets from a pipeline is accomplished through a
*pipeline layout*.
Zero or more descriptor set layouts and zero or more push constant ranges
are combined to form a pipeline layout object describing the complete set of
resources that **can** be accessed by a pipeline.
The pipeline layout represents a sequence of descriptor sets with each
having a specific layout.
This sequence of layouts is used to determine the interface between shader
stages and shader resources.
Each pipeline is created using a pipeline layout.

Pipeline layout objects are represented by `VkPipelineLayout` handles:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkPipelineLayout)

To create a pipeline layout, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VkResult vkCreatePipelineLayout(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo*           pCreateInfo,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator,
    VkPipelineLayout*                           pPipelineLayout);

* 
`device` is the logical device that creates the pipeline layout.

* 
`pCreateInfo` is a pointer to a [VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo](#VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo)
structure specifying the state of the pipeline layout object.

* 
`pAllocator` controls host memory allocation as described in the
[Memory Allocation](memory.html#memory-allocation) chapter.

* 
`pPipelineLayout` is a pointer to a [VkPipelineLayout](#VkPipelineLayout) handle in
which the resulting pipeline layout object is returned.

The [VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo](#VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo) structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo {
    VkStructureType                 sType;
    const void*                     pNext;
    VkPipelineLayoutCreateFlags     flags;

    const VkDescriptorSetLayout*    pSetLayouts;
    uint32_t                        pushConstantRangeCount;
    const VkPushConstantRange*      pPushConstantRanges;
} VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`flags` is a bitmask of [VkPipelineLayoutCreateFlagBits](#VkPipelineLayoutCreateFlagBits)
specifying options for pipeline layout creation.

* 
`setLayoutCount` is the number of descriptor sets included in the
pipeline layout.

* 
`pSetLayouts` is a pointer to an array of
`VkDescriptorSetLayout` objects.
The implementation **must** not access these objects outside of the
duration of the command this structure is passed to.

* 
`pushConstantRangeCount` is the number of push constant ranges
included in the pipeline layout.

* 
`pPushConstantRanges` is a pointer to an array of
[VkPushConstantRange](#VkPushConstantRange) structures defining a set of push constant
ranges for use in a single pipeline layout.
In addition to descriptor set layouts, a pipeline layout also describes
how many push constants **can** be accessed by each stage of the pipeline.

|  | Push constants represent a high speed path to modify constant data in
| --- | --- |
pipelines that is expected to outperform memory-backed resource updates. |

`stageFlags` is a set of stage flags describing the shader stages
that will access a range of push constants.

members of that range of push constants from the corresponding shader
stage will return **undefined** values.

* 
`offset` and `size` are the start offset and size, respectively,

Once created, pipeline layouts are used as part of pipeline creation (see
[Pipelines](pipelines.html#pipelines)), as part of binding descriptor sets (see
[Descriptor Set Binding](#descriptorsets-binding)), and as part of setting
push constants (see [Push Constant Updates](#descriptorsets-push-constants)).
Pipeline creation accepts a pipeline layout as input, and the layout **may** be
used to map (set, binding, arrayElement) tuples to implementation resources
or memory locations within a descriptor set.
The assignment of implementation resources depends only on the bindings
defined in the descriptor sets that comprise the pipeline layout, and not on
any shader source.

All resource variables [statically used](shaders.html#shaders-staticuse) in all shaders
in a pipeline **must** be declared with a (set, binding, arrayElement) that
exists in the corresponding descriptor set layout and is of an appropriate
descriptor type and includes the set of shader stages it is used by in
`stageFlags`.
The pipeline layout **can** include entries that are not used by a particular
pipeline.
The pipeline layout allows the application to provide a consistent set of
bindings across multiple pipeline compiles, which enables those pipelines to
be compiled in a way that the implementation **may** cheaply switch pipelines
without reprogramming the bindings.

Similarly, the push constant block declared in each shader (if present)
**must** only place variables at offsets that are each included in a push
constant range with `stageFlags` including the bit corresponding to the
shader stage that uses it.
The pipeline layout **can** include ranges or portions of ranges that are not
used by a particular pipeline.

There is a limit on the total number of resources of each type that **can** be
included in bindings in all descriptor set layouts in a pipeline layout as
shown in [Pipeline Layout Resource Limits](#descriptorsets-pipelinelayout-limits).
The “Total Resources Available” column gives the limit on the number of
each type of resource that **can** be included in bindings in all descriptor
sets in the pipeline layout.
Some resource types count against multiple limits.
Additionally, there are limits on the total number of each type of resource
that **can** be used in any pipeline stage as described in
[Shader Resource Limits](interfaces.html#interfaces-resources-limits).

Host Synchronization

Two pipeline layouts are defined to be “compatible for
[push constants](#descriptorsets-push-constants)” if they were created
with identical push constant ranges.
Two pipeline layouts are defined to be “compatible for set N” if they were
created with [identically defined](../appendices/glossary.html#glossary-identically-defined) descriptor
set layouts for sets zero through N,
if both of them either were or were not created with
`VK_PIPELINE_LAYOUT_CREATE_INDEPENDENT_SETS_BIT_EXT`,
and if they were created with identical push constant ranges.

When binding a descriptor set (see [Descriptor Set Binding](#descriptorsets-binding)) to set number N, a previously bound descriptor set bound with
lower index M than N is disturbed if the pipeline layouts for set M and N
are not compatible for set M. Otherwise, the bound descriptor set in M is
not disturbed.

If, additionally, the previously bound descriptor set for set N was bound
using a pipeline layout not compatible for set N, then all bindings in sets
numbered greater than N are disturbed.

When binding a pipeline, the pipeline **can** correctly access any previously
bound descriptor set N if it was bound with compatible pipeline layout for
set N, and it was not disturbed.

Layout compatibility means that descriptor sets **can** be bound to a command
buffer for use by any pipeline created with a compatible pipeline layout,
and without having bound a particular pipeline first.
It also means that descriptor sets **can** remain valid across a pipeline
change, and the same resources will be accessible to the newly bound
pipeline.

When a descriptor set is disturbed by binding descriptor sets, the disturbed
set is considered to contain **undefined** descriptors bound with the same
pipeline layout as the disturbing descriptor set.

|  | Place the least frequently changing descriptor sets near the start of the
| --- | --- |
pipeline layout, and place the descriptor sets representing the most
frequently changing resources near the end.
When pipelines are switched, only the descriptor set bindings that have been
invalidated will need to be updated and the remainder of the descriptor set
bindings will remain in place. |

The maximum number of descriptor sets that **can** be bound to a pipeline
layout is queried from physical device properties (see
`maxBoundDescriptorSets` in [Limits](limits.html#limits)).

A *descriptor pool* maintains a pool of descriptors, from which descriptor
sets are allocated.
Descriptor pools are externally synchronized, meaning that the application
**must** not allocate and/or free descriptor sets from the same pool in
multiple threads simultaneously.

Descriptor pools are represented by `VkDescriptorPool` handles:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkDescriptorPool)

To create a descriptor pool object, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VkResult vkCreateDescriptorPool(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo*           pCreateInfo,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator,
    VkDescriptorPool*                           pDescriptorPool);

* 
`device` is the logical device that creates the descriptor pool.

* 
`pCreateInfo` is a pointer to a [VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo)
structure specifying the state of the descriptor pool object.

* 
`pAllocator` controls host memory allocation as described in the
[Memory Allocation](memory.html#memory-allocation) chapter.

* 
`pDescriptorPool` is a pointer to a [VkDescriptorPool](#VkDescriptorPool) handle in
which the resulting descriptor pool object is returned.

The created descriptor pool is returned in `pDescriptorPool`.

Additional information about the pool is passed in a
`VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo` structure:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo {
    VkStructureType                sType;
    const void*                    pNext;
    VkDescriptorPoolCreateFlags    flags;
    uint32_t                       maxSets;
    uint32_t                       poolSizeCount;
    const VkDescriptorPoolSize*    pPoolSizes;
} VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`flags` is a bitmask of [VkDescriptorPoolCreateFlagBits](#VkDescriptorPoolCreateFlagBits)
specifying certain supported operations on the pool.

* 
`maxSets` is the maximum number of descriptor sets that **can** be
allocated from the pool.

* 
`poolSizeCount` is the number of elements in `pPoolSizes`.

* 
`pPoolSizes` is a pointer to an array of [VkDescriptorPoolSize](#VkDescriptorPoolSize)
structures, each containing a descriptor type and number of descriptors
of that type to be allocated in the pool.

If multiple `VkDescriptorPoolSize` structures containing the same
descriptor type appear in the `pPoolSizes` array then the pool will be
created with enough storage for the total number of descriptors of each
type.

Fragmentation of a descriptor pool is possible and **may** lead to descriptor
set allocation failures.
A failure due to fragmentation is defined as failing a descriptor set
allocation despite the sum of all outstanding descriptor set allocations
from the pool plus the requested allocation requiring no more than the total
number of descriptors requested at pool creation.
Implementations provide certain guarantees of when fragmentation **must** not
cause allocation failure, as described below.

If a descriptor pool has not had any descriptor sets freed since it was
created or most recently reset then fragmentation **must** not cause an
allocation failure (note that this is always the case for a pool created
without the `VK_DESCRIPTOR_POOL_CREATE_FREE_DESCRIPTOR_SET_BIT` bit
set).
Additionally, if all sets allocated from the pool since it was created or
most recently reset use the same number of descriptors (of each type) and
the requested allocation also uses that same number of descriptors (of each
type), then fragmentation **must** not cause an allocation failure.

If an allocation failure occurs due to fragmentation, an application **can**
create an additional descriptor pool to perform further descriptor set
allocations.

If `flags` has the `VK_DESCRIPTOR_POOL_CREATE_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT`
bit set, descriptor pool creation **may** fail with the error
`VK_ERROR_FRAGMENTATION` if the total number of descriptors across all
pools (including this one) created with this bit set exceeds
`maxUpdateAfterBindDescriptorsInAllPools`, or if fragmentation of the
underlying hardware resources occurs.

If a `pPoolSizes`[i]::`type` is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT`, a
[VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoEXT](#VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoEXT) structure in the `pNext`
chain **can** be used to specify which mutable descriptor types **can** be
allocated from the pool.
If included in the `pNext` chain,
[VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoEXT](#VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoEXT)::`pMutableDescriptorTypeLists`[i]
specifies which kind of `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT` descriptors
**can** be allocated from this pool entry.
If [VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoEXT](#VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoEXT) does not exist in the
`pNext` chain, or
[VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoEXT](#VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoEXT)::`pMutableDescriptorTypeLists`[i]
is out of range, the descriptor pool allocates enough memory to be able to
allocate a `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT` descriptor with any
supported [VkDescriptorType](#VkDescriptorType) as a mutable descriptor.
A mutable descriptor **can** be allocated from a pool entry if the type list in
[VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo) is a subset of the type list declared
in the descriptor pool, or if the pool entry is created without a descriptor
type list.
Multiple `pPoolSizes` entries with `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT`
**can** be declared.
When multiple such pool entries are present in `pPoolSizes`, they
specify sets of supported descriptor types which either fully overlap,
partially overlap, or are disjoint.
Two sets fully overlap if the sets of supported descriptor types are equal.
If the sets are not disjoint they partially overlap.
A pool entry without a `VkMutableDescriptorTypeListEXT` assigned to it
is considered to partially overlap any other pool entry which has a
`VkMutableDescriptorTypeListEXT` assigned to it.
The application **must** ensure that partial overlap does not exist in
`pPoolSizes`.

|  | The requirement of no partial overlap is intended to resolve ambiguity for
| --- | --- |
validation as there is no confusion which `pPoolSizes` entries will be
allocated from.
An implementation is not expected to depend on this requirement. |

In order to be able to allocate descriptor sets having
[inline uniform block](#descriptorsets-inlineuniformblock) bindings the
descriptor pool **must** be created with specifying the inline uniform block
binding capacity of the descriptor pool, in addition to the total inline
uniform data capacity in bytes which is specified through a
[VkDescriptorPoolSize](#VkDescriptorPoolSize) structure with a `descriptorType` value of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK`.
This **can** be done by adding a
`VkDescriptorPoolInlineUniformBlockCreateInfo` structure to the
`pNext` chain of [VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo).

The `VkDescriptorPoolInlineUniformBlockCreateInfo` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_EXT_inline_uniform_block
typedef VkDescriptorPoolInlineUniformBlockCreateInfo VkDescriptorPoolInlineUniformBlockCreateInfoEXT;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this

} VkDescriptorPoolCreateFlagBits;

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_POOL_CREATE_FREE_DESCRIPTOR_SET_BIT` specifies that
descriptor sets **can** return their individual allocations to the pool,
i.e. all of [vkAllocateDescriptorSets](#vkAllocateDescriptorSets), [vkFreeDescriptorSets](#vkFreeDescriptorSets),
and [vkResetDescriptorPool](#vkResetDescriptorPool) are allowed.
Otherwise, descriptor sets allocated from the pool **must** not be
individually freed back to the pool, i.e. only
[vkAllocateDescriptorSets](#vkAllocateDescriptorSets) and [vkResetDescriptorPool](#vkResetDescriptorPool) are
allowed.

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_POOL_CREATE_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT` specifies that
descriptor sets allocated from this pool **can** include bindings with the
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT` bit set.
It is valid to allocate descriptor sets that have bindings that do not
set the `VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT` bit from a
pool that has `VK_DESCRIPTOR_POOL_CREATE_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT` set.

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_POOL_CREATE_HOST_ONLY_BIT_EXT` specifies that this
descriptor pool and the descriptor sets allocated from it reside
entirely in host memory and cannot be bound.
Similar to descriptor sets allocated without this flag, applications
**can** copy-from and copy-to descriptors sets allocated from this
descriptor pool.
Descriptor sets allocated from this pool are partially exempt from the
external synchronization requirement in
[vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplateKHR](#vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplateKHR) and
[vkUpdateDescriptorSets](#vkUpdateDescriptorSets).
Descriptor sets and their descriptors can be updated concurrently in
different threads, though the same descriptor **must** not be updated
concurrently by two threads.

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_POOL_CREATE_ALLOW_OVERALLOCATION_SETS_BIT_NV`
specifies that the implementation should allow the application to
allocate more than [VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo)::`maxSets`
descriptor set objects from the descriptor pool as available resources
allow.
The implementation **may** use the `maxSets` value to allocate the
initial available sets, but using zero is permitted.

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_POOL_CREATE_ALLOW_OVERALLOCATION_POOLS_BIT_NV`
specifies that the implementation should allow the application to
allocate more descriptors from the pool than was specified by the
[VkDescriptorPoolSize](#VkDescriptorPoolSize)::`descriptorCount` for any descriptor
type as specified by
[VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo)::`poolSizeCount` and
[VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo)::`pPoolSizes`, as available
resources allow.
The implementation **may** use the `descriptorCount` for each
descriptor type to allocate the initial pool, but the application is
allowed to set the `poolSizeCount` to zero, or any of the
`descriptorCount` values in the `pPoolSizes` array to zero.

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef VkFlags VkDescriptorPoolCreateFlags;

`VkDescriptorPoolCreateFlags` is a bitmask type for setting a mask of
zero or more [VkDescriptorPoolCreateFlagBits](#VkDescriptorPoolCreateFlagBits).

The `VkDescriptorPoolSize` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkDescriptorPoolSize {
    VkDescriptorType    type;
    uint32_t            descriptorCount;
} VkDescriptorPoolSize;

* 
`type` is the type of descriptor.

* 
`descriptorCount` is the number of descriptors of that type to
allocate.
If `type` is `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK` then
`descriptorCount` is the number of bytes to allocate for descriptors
of this type.

|  | When creating a descriptor pool that will contain descriptors for combined
| --- | --- |
image samplers of [multi-planar formats](formats.html#formats-multiplanar), an
application needs to account for non-trivial descriptor consumption when
choosing the `descriptorCount` value, as indicated by
[VkSamplerYcbcrConversionImageFormatProperties](capabilities.html#VkSamplerYcbcrConversionImageFormatProperties)::`combinedImageSamplerDescriptorCount`.

For simplicity the application **can** use the
[VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance6Properties](limits.html#VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance6Properties)::`maxCombinedImageSamplerDescriptorCount`
property, which is sized to accommodate any and all
[formats that require a sampler Y′CBCR conversion](formats.html#formats-requiring-sampler-ycbcr-conversion) supported by the implementation. |

`device` is the logical device that destroys the descriptor pool.

* 
`descriptorPool` is the descriptor pool to destroy.

* 
`pAllocator` controls host memory allocation as described in the

Descriptor sets are allocated from descriptor pool objects, and are
represented by `VkDescriptorSet` handles:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkDescriptorSet)

To allocate descriptor sets from a descriptor pool, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VkResult vkAllocateDescriptorSets(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkDescriptorSetAllocateInfo*          pAllocateInfo,
    VkDescriptorSet*                            pDescriptorSets);

* 
`device` is the logical device that owns the descriptor pool.

* 
`pAllocateInfo` is a pointer to a [VkDescriptorSetAllocateInfo](#VkDescriptorSetAllocateInfo)
structure describing parameters of the allocation.

* 
`pDescriptorSets` is a pointer to an array of [VkDescriptorSet](#VkDescriptorSet)
handles in which the resulting descriptor set objects are returned.

The allocated descriptor sets are returned in `pDescriptorSets`.

When a descriptor set is allocated, the initial state is largely
uninitialized and all descriptors are **undefined**, with the exception that
samplers with a non-null `pImmutableSamplers` are initialized on
allocation.
Descriptors also become **undefined** if the underlying resource or view object
is destroyed.
Descriptor sets containing **undefined** descriptors **can** still be bound and
used, subject to the following conditions:

* 
For descriptor set bindings created with the
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_PARTIALLY_BOUND_BIT` bit set, all descriptors
in that binding that are dynamically used **must** have been populated
before the descriptor set is [consumed](#descriptorsets-binding).

* 
For descriptor set bindings created without the
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_PARTIALLY_BOUND_BIT` bit set, all descriptors
in that binding that are statically used **must** have been populated
before the descriptor set is [consumed](#descriptorsets-binding).

* 
Descriptor bindings with descriptor type of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK` **can** be **undefined** when
the descriptor set is [consumed](#descriptorsets-binding); though values
in that block will be **undefined**.

* 
Entries that are not used by a pipeline **can** have **undefined**
descriptors.

If a call to `vkAllocateDescriptorSets` would cause the total number of
descriptor sets allocated from the pool to exceed the value of
[VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo)::`maxSets` used to create
`pAllocateInfo->descriptorPool`, then the allocation **may** fail due to
lack of space in the descriptor pool.
Similarly, the allocation **may** fail due to lack of space if the call to
`vkAllocateDescriptorSets` would cause the number of any given
descriptor type to exceed the sum of all the `descriptorCount` members
of each element of [VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo)::`pPoolSizes` with a
`type` equal to that type.

Additionally, the allocation **may** also fail if a call to
`vkAllocateDescriptorSets` would cause the total number of inline
uniform block bindings allocated from the pool to exceed the value of
[VkDescriptorPoolInlineUniformBlockCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorPoolInlineUniformBlockCreateInfo)::`maxInlineUniformBlockBindings`
used to create the descriptor pool.

If the allocation fails due to no more space in the descriptor pool, and not
because of system or device memory exhaustion, then
`VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_POOL_MEMORY` **must** be returned.

`vkAllocateDescriptorSets` **can** be used to create multiple descriptor
sets.
If the creation of any of those descriptor sets fails, then the
implementation **must** destroy all successfully created descriptor set objects
from this command, set all entries of the `pDescriptorSets` array to
[VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE) and return the error.

To return all descriptor sets allocated from a given pool to the pool,
rather than freeing individual descriptor sets, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VkResult vkResetDescriptorPool(
    VkDevice                                    device,

* 
`device` is the logical device that owns the descriptor pool.

* 
`descriptorPool` is the descriptor pool to be reset.

* 
`flags` is reserved for future use.

Resetting a descriptor pool recycles all of the resources from all of the
descriptor sets allocated from the descriptor pool back to the descriptor
pool, and the descriptor sets are implicitly freed.

typedef VkFlags VkDescriptorPoolResetFlags;

`VkDescriptorPoolResetFlags` is a bitmask type for setting a mask, but
is currently reserved for future use.

Once allocated, descriptor sets **can** be updated with a combination of write
and copy operations.
To update descriptor sets, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
void vkUpdateDescriptorSets(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    uint32_t                                    descriptorWriteCount,
    const VkWriteDescriptorSet*                 pDescriptorWrites,
    uint32_t                                    descriptorCopyCount,
    const VkCopyDescriptorSet*                  pDescriptorCopies);

* 
`device` is the logical device that updates the descriptor sets.

* 
`descriptorWriteCount` is the number of elements in the
`pDescriptorWrites` array.

* 
`pDescriptorWrites` is a pointer to an array of
[VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet) structures describing the descriptor sets to
write to.

* 
`descriptorCopyCount` is the number of elements in the
`pDescriptorCopies` array.

* 
`pDescriptorCopies` is a pointer to an array of
[VkCopyDescriptorSet](#VkCopyDescriptorSet) structures describing the descriptor sets to
copy between.

The operations described by `pDescriptorWrites` are performed first,
followed by the operations described by `pDescriptorCopies`.
Within each array, the operations are performed in the order they appear in
the array.

Each element in the `pDescriptorWrites` array describes an operation
updating the descriptor set using descriptors for resources specified in the
structure.

Each element in the `pDescriptorCopies` array is a
[VkCopyDescriptorSet](#VkCopyDescriptorSet) structure describing an operation copying
descriptors between sets.

If the `dstSet` member of any element of `pDescriptorWrites` or
`pDescriptorCopies` is bound, accessed, or modified by any command that
was recorded to a command buffer which is currently in the
[recording or executable state](cmdbuffers.html#commandbuffers-lifecycle),
and any of the descriptor bindings that are updated were not created with
the `VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT` or
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_UNUSED_WHILE_PENDING_BIT` bits set,
that command buffer becomes [invalid](cmdbuffers.html#commandbuffers-lifecycle).

Copying a descriptor from a descriptor set does not constitute a use of the
referenced resource or view, as it is the reference itself that is copied.
Applications **can** copy a descriptor referencing a destroyed resource, and it
**can** copy an **undefined** descriptor.
The destination descriptor becomes **undefined** in both cases.

typedef struct VkWriteDescriptorSet {

} VkWriteDescriptorSet;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`dstSet` is the destination descriptor set to update.

* 
`dstBinding` is the descriptor binding within that set.

* 
`dstArrayElement` is the starting element in that array.
If the descriptor binding identified by `dstSet` and
`dstBinding` has a descriptor type of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK` then `dstArrayElement`
specifies the starting byte offset within the binding.

* 
`descriptorCount` is the number of descriptors to update.
If the descriptor binding identified by `dstSet` and
`dstBinding` has a descriptor type of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK`, then
`descriptorCount` specifies the number of bytes to update.
Otherwise,
`descriptorCount` is one of

*

*

* 
a value matching the `dataSize` member of a

[VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureKHR](#VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureKHR)
or
[VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureNV](#VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureNV)
     structure in the `pNext` chain

`descriptorType` is a [VkDescriptorType](#VkDescriptorType) specifying the type of
each descriptor in `pImageInfo`, `pBufferInfo`, or
`pTexelBufferView`, as described below.
If `VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding` for `dstSet` at
`dstBinding` is not equal to `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT`,
`descriptorType` **must**
be the same type as the `descriptorType` specified in
`VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding` for `dstSet` at `dstBinding`.
The type of the descriptor also controls which array the descriptors are
taken from.

`pImageInfo` is a pointer to an array of [VkDescriptorImageInfo](#VkDescriptorImageInfo)
structures or is ignored, as described below.

`pBufferInfo` is a pointer to an array of
[VkDescriptorBufferInfo](#VkDescriptorBufferInfo) structures or is ignored, as described
below.

`pTexelBufferView` is a pointer to an array of [VkBufferView](resources.html#VkBufferView)
handles as described in the [Buffer Views](resources.html#resources-buffer-views)
section or is ignored, as described below.

Only one of `pImageInfo`, `pBufferInfo`, or `pTexelBufferView`
members is used according to the descriptor type specified in the
`descriptorType` member of the containing `VkWriteDescriptorSet`
structure,
or none of them in case `descriptorType` is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK`, in which case the source data
for the descriptor writes is taken from the
[VkWriteDescriptorSetInlineUniformBlock](#VkWriteDescriptorSetInlineUniformBlock) structure included in the
`pNext` chain of `VkWriteDescriptorSet`,
or if `descriptorType` is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_KHR`, in which case the
source data for the descriptor writes is taken from the
[VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureKHR](#VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureKHR) structure in the
`pNext` chain of `VkWriteDescriptorSet`,
or if `descriptorType` is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_NV`, in which case the source
data for the descriptor writes is taken from the
[VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureNV](#VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureNV) structure in the
`pNext` chain of `VkWriteDescriptorSet`,
as specified below.

If the [`nullDescriptor`](features.html#features-nullDescriptor) feature is enabled,
the buffer,
acceleration structure,
imageView, or bufferView **can** be [VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE).
Loads from a null descriptor return zero values and stores and atomics to a
null descriptor are discarded.
A null acceleration structure descriptor results in the miss shader being
invoked.

If the destination descriptor is a mutable descriptor, the active descriptor
type for the destination descriptor becomes `descriptorType`.

Consecutive Binding Updates
If the `dstBinding` has fewer than `descriptorCount` array elements
remaining starting from `dstArrayElement`, then the remainder will be
used to update the subsequent binding - `dstBinding`+1 starting at
array element zero.
If a binding has a `descriptorCount` of zero, it is skipped.
This behavior applies recursively, with the update affecting consecutive
bindings as needed to update all `descriptorCount` descriptors.
Consecutive bindings **must** have identical [VkDescriptorType](#VkDescriptorType),
[VkShaderStageFlags](pipelines.html#VkShaderStageFlags),
[VkDescriptorBindingFlagBits](#VkDescriptorBindingFlagBits),
and immutable samplers references.
In addition, if the [VkDescriptorType](#VkDescriptorType) is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT`, the supported descriptor types in
[VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoEXT](#VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoEXT) **must** be equally defined.

|  | The same behavior applies to bindings with a descriptor type of
| --- | --- |
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK` where `descriptorCount`
specifies the number of bytes to update while `dstArrayElement`
specifies the starting byte offset, thus in this case if the
`dstBinding` has a smaller byte size than the sum of
`dstArrayElement` and `descriptorCount`, then the remainder will be
used to update the subsequent binding - `dstBinding`+1 starting at
offset zero.
This falls out as a special case of the above rule. |

When a descriptor set is updated via elements of [VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet),
members of `pImageInfo`, `pBufferInfo` and `pTexelBufferView`
are only accessed by the implementation when they correspond to descriptor
type being defined - otherwise they are ignored.
The members accessed are as follows for each descriptor type:

* 
For `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLER`, only the `sampler` member of
each element of [VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet)::`pImageInfo` is
accessed.

* 
For `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLED_IMAGE`,
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_IMAGE`, or
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT`, only the `imageView` and
`imageLayout` members of each element of
[VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet)::`pImageInfo` are accessed.

* 
For `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER`, all members of each
element of [VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet)::`pImageInfo` are accessed.

* 
For `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER`,
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER`,
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC`, or
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER_DYNAMIC`, all members of each
element of [VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet)::`pBufferInfo` are accessed.

* 
For `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER` or
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER`, each element of
[VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet)::`pTexelBufferView` is accessed.

When updating descriptors with a `descriptorType` of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK`, none of the `pImageInfo`,
`pBufferInfo`, or `pTexelBufferView` members are accessed, instead
the source data of the descriptor update operation is taken from the
[VkWriteDescriptorSetInlineUniformBlock](#VkWriteDescriptorSetInlineUniformBlock) structure in the `pNext`
chain of `VkWriteDescriptorSet`.
When updating descriptors with a `descriptorType` of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_KHR`, none of the
`pImageInfo`, `pBufferInfo`, or `pTexelBufferView` members are
accessed, instead the source data of the descriptor update operation is
taken from the [VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureKHR](#VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureKHR) structure
in the `pNext` chain of `VkWriteDescriptorSet`.
When updating descriptors with a `descriptorType` of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_NV`, none of the
`pImageInfo`, `pBufferInfo`, or `pTexelBufferView` members are
accessed, instead the source data of the descriptor update operation is
taken from the [VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureNV](#VkWriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureNV) structure
in the `pNext` chain of `VkWriteDescriptorSet`.

The `VkDescriptorBufferInfo` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkDescriptorBufferInfo {
    VkBuffer        buffer;
    VkDeviceSize    offset;
    VkDeviceSize    range;
} VkDescriptorBufferInfo;

* 
`buffer` is
[VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE) or
the buffer resource.

* 
`offset` is the offset in bytes from the start of `buffer`.
Access to buffer memory via this descriptor uses addressing that is
relative to this starting offset.

* 
`range` is the size in bytes that is used for this descriptor
update, or `VK_WHOLE_SIZE` to use the range from `offset` to the
end of the buffer.

|  | When setting `range` to `VK_WHOLE_SIZE`, the
| --- | --- |
[effective range](#buffer-info-effective-range) **must** not be larger than
the maximum range for the descriptor type ([`maxUniformBufferRange`](limits.html#limits-maxUniformBufferRange) or [`maxStorageBufferRange`](limits.html#limits-maxStorageBufferRange)).
This means that `VK_WHOLE_SIZE` is not typically useful in the common
case where uniform buffer descriptors are suballocated from a buffer that is
much larger than `maxUniformBufferRange`. |

For `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC` and
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER_DYNAMIC` descriptor types,
`offset` is the base offset from which the dynamic offset is applied and
`range` is the static size used for all dynamic offsets.

When `range` is `VK_WHOLE_SIZE` the effective range is calculated at
[vkUpdateDescriptorSets](#vkUpdateDescriptorSets) is by taking the size of `buffer` minus the
`offset`.

typedef struct VkDescriptorImageInfo {
    VkSampler        sampler;
    VkImageView      imageView;
    VkImageLayout    imageLayout;
} VkDescriptorImageInfo;

* 
`sampler` is a sampler handle, and is used in descriptor updates for
types `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLER` and
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER` if the binding being
updated does not use immutable samplers.

* 
`imageView` is
[VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE) or
an image view handle, and is used in descriptor updates for types
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLED_IMAGE`,
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_IMAGE`,
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER`, and
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT`.

* 
`imageLayout` is the layout that the image subresources accessible
from `imageView` will be in at the time this descriptor is accessed.
`imageLayout` is used in descriptor updates for types
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLED_IMAGE`,
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_IMAGE`,
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER`, and
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT`.

Members of `VkDescriptorImageInfo` that are not used in an update (as
described above) are ignored.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`srcSet`, `srcBinding`, and `srcArrayElement` are the source
set, binding, and array element, respectively.
If the descriptor binding identified by `srcSet` and
`srcBinding` has a descriptor type of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK` then `srcArrayElement`
specifies the starting byte offset within the binding to copy from.

* 
`dstSet`, `dstBinding`, and `dstArrayElement` are the

If the descriptor binding identified by `dstSet` and
`dstBinding` has a descriptor type of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK` then `dstArrayElement`
specifies the starting byte offset within the binding to copy to.

* 
`descriptorCount` is the number of descriptors to copy from the
source to destination.
If `descriptorCount` is greater than the number of remaining array
elements in the source or destination binding, those affect consecutive
bindings in a manner similar to [VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet) above.
If the descriptor binding identified by `srcSet` and
`srcBinding` has a descriptor type of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK` then `descriptorCount`
specifies the number of bytes to copy and the remaining array elements
in the source or destination binding refer to the remaining number of
bytes in those.

If the `VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding` for `dstBinding` is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT` and `srcBinding` is not
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_EXT`, the new active descriptor type becomes
the descriptor type of `srcBinding`.

descriptor type in each source descriptor is copied into the corresponding
destination descriptor.
The active descriptor type **can** be different for each source descriptor.

|  | The intention is that copies to and from mutable descriptors is a simple

memcpy.
Copies between non-mutable and mutable descriptors are expected to require
one memcpy per descriptor to handle the difference in size, but this use

A descriptor update template specifies a mapping from descriptor update
information in host memory to descriptors in a descriptor set.
It is designed to avoid passing redundant information to the driver when
frequently updating the same set of descriptors in descriptor sets.

Descriptor update template objects are represented by
`VkDescriptorUpdateTemplate` handles:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkDescriptorUpdateTemplate)

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template
typedef VkDescriptorUpdateTemplate VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateKHR;

Updating a large `VkDescriptorSet` array **can** be an expensive operation
since an application **must** specify one [VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet) structure
for each descriptor or descriptor array to update, each of which
re-specifies the same state when updating the same descriptor in multiple
descriptor sets.
For cases when an application wishes to update the same set of descriptors
in multiple descriptor sets allocated using the same
`VkDescriptorSetLayout`, [vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplate](#vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplate) **can** be
used as a replacement for [vkUpdateDescriptorSets](#vkUpdateDescriptorSets).

`VkDescriptorUpdateTemplate` allows implementations to convert a set of
descriptor update operations on a single descriptor set to an internal
format.
In conjunction with
[vkCmdPushDescriptorSetWithTemplate](#vkCmdPushDescriptorSetWithTemplate) or
[vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplate](#vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplate), this **can** be more efficient
compared to calling
[vkCmdPushDescriptorSet](#vkCmdPushDescriptorSet) or
[vkUpdateDescriptorSets](#vkUpdateDescriptorSets).
The descriptors themselves are not specified in the
`VkDescriptorUpdateTemplate`, rather, offsets into an application
provided pointer to host memory are specified, which are combined with a
pointer passed to
[vkCmdPushDescriptorSetWithTemplate](#vkCmdPushDescriptorSetWithTemplate) or
[vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplate](#vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplate).
This allows large batches of updates to be executed without having to
convert application data structures into a strictly-defined Vulkan data
structure.

To create a descriptor update template, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
VkResult vkCreateDescriptorUpdateTemplate(
    VkDevice                                    device,

    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator,
    VkDescriptorUpdateTemplate*                 pDescriptorUpdateTemplate);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template
VkResult vkCreateDescriptorUpdateTemplateKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateCreateInfo* pCreateInfo,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator,
    VkDescriptorUpdateTemplate*                 pDescriptorUpdateTemplate);

* 
`device` is the logical device that creates the descriptor update
template.

* 
`pCreateInfo` is a pointer to a
    [VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateCreateInfo) structure specifying the set
    of descriptors to update with a single call to
[vkCmdPushDescriptorSetWithTemplate](#vkCmdPushDescriptorSetWithTemplate) or
    [vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplate](#vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplate).

* 
`pAllocator` controls host memory allocation as described in the
[Memory Allocation](memory.html#memory-allocation) chapter.

* 
`pDescriptorUpdateTemplate` is a pointer to a
`VkDescriptorUpdateTemplate` handle in which the resulting
descriptor update template object is returned.

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef VkFlags VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateCreateFlags;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template
typedef VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateCreateFlags VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateCreateFlagsKHR;

`VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateCreateFlags` is a bitmask type for setting a
mask, but is currently reserved for future use.

The descriptor update template type is determined by the
[VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateCreateInfo)::`templateType` property,
which takes the following values:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef enum VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateType {
    VK_DESCRIPTOR_UPDATE_TEMPLATE_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR_SET = 0,
  // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4
    VK_DESCRIPTOR_UPDATE_TEMPLATE_TYPE_PUSH_DESCRIPTORS = 1,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template with VK_KHR_push_descriptor, VK_KHR_push_descriptor with VK_VERSION_1_1 or VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template
    VK_DESCRIPTOR_UPDATE_TEMPLATE_TYPE_PUSH_DESCRIPTORS_KHR = VK_DESCRIPTOR_UPDATE_TEMPLATE_TYPE_PUSH_DESCRIPTORS,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template
    VK_DESCRIPTOR_UPDATE_TEMPLATE_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR_SET_KHR = VK_DESCRIPTOR_UPDATE_TEMPLATE_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR_SET,
} VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateType;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template
typedef VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateType VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateTypeKHR;

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_UPDATE_TEMPLATE_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR_SET` specifies that
the descriptor update template will be used for descriptor set updates
only.

* 
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_UPDATE_TEMPLATE_TYPE_PUSH_DESCRIPTORS` specifies that
the descriptor update template will be used for push descriptor updates
only.

The `VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateEntry` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef struct VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateEntry {
    uint32_t            dstBinding;
    uint32_t            dstArrayElement;
    uint32_t            descriptorCount;
    VkDescriptorType    descriptorType;
    size_t              offset;
    size_t              stride;
} VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateEntry;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template
typedef VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateEntry VkDescriptorUpdateTemplateEntryKHR;

* 
`dstBinding` is the descriptor binding to update when using this
descriptor update template.

* 
`dstArrayElement` is the starting element in the array belonging to
`dstBinding`.
If the descriptor binding identified by `dstBinding` has a
descriptor type of `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK` then
`dstArrayElement` specifies the starting byte offset to update.

* 
`descriptorCount` is the number of descriptors to update.
If `descriptorCount` is greater than the number of remaining array
elements in the destination binding, those affect consecutive bindings
in a manner similar to [VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet) above.
If the descriptor binding identified by `dstBinding` has a
descriptor type of `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK` then
`descriptorCount` specifies the number of bytes to update and the
remaining array elements in the destination binding refer to the
remaining number of bytes in it.

* 
`descriptorType` is a [VkDescriptorType](#VkDescriptorType) specifying the type of
the descriptor.

* 
`offset` is the offset in bytes of the first binding in the raw data
structure.

* 
`stride` is the stride in bytes between two consecutive array
elements of the descriptor update information in the raw data structure.
The actual pointer ptr for each array element j of update entry i is
computed using the following formula:

    const char *ptr = (const char *)pData + pDescriptorUpdateEntries[i].offset + j * pDescriptorUpdateEntries[i].stride

The stride is useful in case the bindings are stored in structs along with
other data.
If `descriptorType` is `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK`
then the value of `stride` is ignored and the stride is assumed to be
`1`, i.e. the descriptor update information for them is always specified as
a contiguous range.

To bind one or more descriptor sets to a command buffer, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
void vkCmdBindDescriptorSets(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkPipelineBindPoint                         pipelineBindPoint,
    VkPipelineLayout                            layout,
    uint32_t                                    firstSet,

    const VkDescriptorSet*                      pDescriptorSets,
    uint32_t                                    dynamicOffsetCount,
    const uint32_t*                             pDynamicOffsets);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer that the descriptor sets will
be bound to.

* 
`pipelineBindPoint` is a [VkPipelineBindPoint](pipelines.html#VkPipelineBindPoint) indicating the
type of the pipeline that will use the descriptors.
There is a separate set of bind points for each pipeline type, so
binding one does not disturb the others.

* 
`layout` is a [VkPipelineLayout](#VkPipelineLayout) object used to program the
bindings.

* 
`firstSet` is the set number of the first descriptor set to be
bound.

* 
`descriptorSetCount` is the number of elements in the
`pDescriptorSets` array.

* 
`pDescriptorSets` is a pointer to an array of handles to
[VkDescriptorSet](#VkDescriptorSet) objects describing the descriptor sets to bind to.

* 
`dynamicOffsetCount` is the number of dynamic offsets in the
`pDynamicOffsets` array.

* 
`pDynamicOffsets` is a pointer to an array of `uint32_t` values
specifying dynamic offsets.

`vkCmdBindDescriptorSets` binds descriptor sets
`pDescriptorSets`[0..`descriptorSetCount`-1] to set numbers
[`firstSet`..`firstSet`+`descriptorSetCount`-1] for subsequent
[bound pipeline commands](pipelines.html#pipelines-bindpoint-commands) set by
`pipelineBindPoint`.
Any bindings that were previously applied via these sets
, or calls to [vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT](#vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT) or
[vkCmdBindDescriptorBufferEmbeddedSamplersEXT](#vkCmdBindDescriptorBufferEmbeddedSamplersEXT),
are no longer valid.

Once bound, a descriptor set affects rendering of subsequent commands that
interact with the given pipeline type in the command buffer until either a
different set is bound to the same set number, or the set is disturbed as
described in [Pipeline Layout Compatibility](#descriptorsets-compatibility).

A compatible descriptor set **must** be bound for all set numbers that any
shaders in a pipeline access, at the time that a drawing or dispatching
command is recorded to execute using that pipeline.
However, if none of the shaders in a pipeline statically use any bindings
with a particular set number, then no descriptor set need be bound for that
set number, even if the pipeline layout includes a non-trivial descriptor
set layout for that set number.

When consuming a descriptor, a descriptor is considered valid if the
descriptor is not **undefined** as described by
[descriptor set allocation](#descriptor-set-initial-state).
If the [`nullDescriptor`](features.html#features-nullDescriptor) feature is enabled,
a null descriptor is also considered valid.
A descriptor that was disturbed by [Pipeline Layout Compatibility](#descriptorsets-compatibility), or was never bound by `vkCmdBindDescriptorSets`
is not considered valid.
If a pipeline accesses a descriptor either statically or dynamically
depending on the [VkDescriptorBindingFlagBits](#VkDescriptorBindingFlagBits), the consuming descriptor
type in the pipeline **must** match the [VkDescriptorType](#VkDescriptorType) in
[VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo](#VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo) for the descriptor to be considered
valid.
If a descriptor is a mutable descriptor, the consuming descriptor type in
the pipeline **must** match the active descriptor type for the descriptor to be
considered valid.

|  | Further validation may be carried out beyond validation for descriptor
| --- | --- |
types, e.g. [Texel Input Validation](textures.html#textures-input-validation). |

If any of the sets being bound include dynamic uniform or storage buffers,
then `pDynamicOffsets` includes one element for each array element in
each dynamic descriptor type binding in each set.
Values are taken from `pDynamicOffsets` in an order such that all
entries for set N come before set N+1; within a set, entries are ordered by
the binding numbers in the descriptor set layouts; and within a binding
array, elements are in order.
`dynamicOffsetCount` **must** equal the total number of dynamic descriptors
in the sets being bound.

The effective offset used for dynamic uniform and storage buffer bindings is
the sum of the relative offset taken from `pDynamicOffsets`, and the
base address of the buffer plus base offset in the descriptor set.
The range of the dynamic uniform and storage buffer bindings is the buffer
range as specified in the descriptor set.

Each of the `pDescriptorSets` **must** be compatible with the pipeline
layout specified by `layout`.
The layout used to program the bindings **must** also be compatible with the
pipeline used in subsequent [bound pipeline commands](pipelines.html#pipelines-bindpoint-commands) with that pipeline type, as defined in the
[Pipeline Layout Compatibility](#descriptorsets-compatibility) section.

The descriptor set contents bound by a call to `vkCmdBindDescriptorSets`
**may** be consumed at the following times:

* 
For descriptor bindings created with the
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT` bit set, the contents
**may** be consumed when the command buffer is submitted to a queue, or
during shader execution of the resulting draws and dispatches, or any
time in between.
Otherwise,

* 
during host execution of the command, or during shader execution of the
resulting draws and dispatches, or any time in between.

Thus, the contents of a descriptor set binding **must** not be altered
(overwritten by an update command, or freed) between the first point in time
that it **may** be consumed, and when the command completes executing on the
queue.

The contents of `pDynamicOffsets` are consumed immediately during
execution of `vkCmdBindDescriptorSets`.
Once all pending uses have completed, it is legal to update and reuse a
descriptor set.

The `VkBindDescriptorSetsInfo` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4
typedef struct VkBindDescriptorSetsInfo {
    VkStructureType           sType;
    const void*               pNext;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance6
typedef VkBindDescriptorSetsInfo VkBindDescriptorSetsInfoKHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`stageFlags` is a bitmask of [VkShaderStageFlagBits](pipelines.html#VkShaderStageFlagBits) specifying
the shader stages the descriptor sets will be bound to.

* 
`layout` is a [VkPipelineLayout](#VkPipelineLayout) object used to program the
bindings.
If the [`dynamicPipelineLayout`](features.html#features-dynamicPipelineLayout)
feature is enabled, `layout` **can** be [VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE) and the

* 
`firstSet` is the set number of the first descriptor set to be
bound.

* 
`descriptorSetCount` is the number of elements in the

`dynamicOffsetCount` is the number of dynamic offsets in the
`pDynamicOffsets` array.

* 
`pDynamicOffsets` is a pointer to an array of `uint32_t` values
specifying dynamic offsets.

If `stageFlags` specifies a subset of all stages corresponding to one or
more pipeline bind points, the binding operation still affects all stages
corresponding to the given pipeline bind point(s) as if the equivalent
original version of this command had been called with the same parameters.
For example, specifying a `stageFlags` value of
`VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT` | `VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT` |
`VK_SHADER_STAGE_COMPUTE_BIT` is equivalent to calling the original
version of this command once with `VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS` and
once with `VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE`.

In addition to allocating descriptor sets and binding them to a command
buffer, an application **can** record descriptor updates into the command
buffer.

To push descriptor updates into a command buffer, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4
void vkCmdPushDescriptorSet(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkPipelineBindPoint                         pipelineBindPoint,
    VkPipelineLayout                            layout,

    uint32_t                                    descriptorWriteCount,
    const VkWriteDescriptorSet*                 pDescriptorWrites);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_push_descriptor
void vkCmdPushDescriptorSetKHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkPipelineBindPoint                         pipelineBindPoint,
    VkPipelineLayout                            layout,
    uint32_t                                    set,
    uint32_t                                    descriptorWriteCount,
    const VkWriteDescriptorSet*                 pDescriptorWrites);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer that the descriptors will be
recorded in.

* 
`pipelineBindPoint` is a [VkPipelineBindPoint](pipelines.html#VkPipelineBindPoint) indicating the
type of the pipeline that will use the descriptors.
There is a separate set of push descriptor bindings for each pipeline
type, so binding one does not disturb the others.

* 
`layout` is a [VkPipelineLayout](#VkPipelineLayout) object used to program the
bindings.

* 
`set` is the set number of the descriptor set in the pipeline layout
that will be updated.

* 
`descriptorWriteCount` is the number of elements in the
`pDescriptorWrites` array.

* 
`pDescriptorWrites` is a pointer to an array of
[VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet) structures describing the descriptors to be
updated.

*Push descriptors* are a small bank of descriptors whose storage is
internally managed by the command buffer rather than being written into a
descriptor set and later bound to a command buffer.
Push descriptors allow for incremental updates of descriptors without
managing the lifetime of descriptor sets.

When a command buffer begins recording, all push descriptors are **undefined**.
Push descriptors **can** be updated incrementally and cause shaders to use the
updated descriptors for subsequent [bound pipeline commands](pipelines.html#pipelines-bindpoint-commands) with the pipeline type set by `pipelineBindPoint`
until the descriptor is overwritten, or else until the set is disturbed as
described in [Pipeline Layout Compatibility](#descriptorsets-compatibility).
When the set is disturbed or push descriptors with a different descriptor
set layout are set, all push descriptors are **undefined**.

Push descriptors that are [statically used](shaders.html#shaders-staticuse) by a
pipeline **must** not be **undefined** at the time that a drawing or dispatching
command is recorded to execute using that pipeline.
This includes immutable sampler descriptors, which **must** be pushed before
they are accessed by a pipeline (the immutable samplers are pushed, rather
than the samplers in `pDescriptorWrites`).
Push descriptors that are not statically used **can** remain **undefined**.

Push descriptors do not use dynamic offsets.
Instead, the corresponding non-dynamic descriptor types **can** be used and the
`offset` member of [VkDescriptorBufferInfo](#VkDescriptorBufferInfo) **can** be changed each
time the descriptor is written.

Each element of `pDescriptorWrites` is interpreted as in
[VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet), except the `dstSet` member is ignored.

To push an immutable sampler, use a [VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet) with
`dstBinding` and `dstArrayElement` selecting the immutable sampler’s
binding.
If the descriptor type is `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLER`, the
`pImageInfo` parameter is ignored and the immutable sampler is taken
from the push descriptor set layout in the pipeline layout.
If the descriptor type is `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER`,
the `sampler` member of the `pImageInfo` parameter is ignored and
the immutable sampler is taken from the push descriptor set layout in the
pipeline layout.

The `VkPushDescriptorSetInfo` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4
typedef struct VkPushDescriptorSetInfo {
    VkStructureType                sType;
    const void*                    pNext;
    VkShaderStageFlags             stageFlags;
    VkPipelineLayout               layout;
    uint32_t                       set;
    uint32_t                       descriptorWriteCount;
    const VkWriteDescriptorSet*    pDescriptorWrites;
} VkPushDescriptorSetInfo;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance6 with VK_KHR_push_descriptor
typedef VkPushDescriptorSetInfo VkPushDescriptorSetInfoKHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`stageFlags` is a bitmask of [VkShaderStageFlagBits](pipelines.html#VkShaderStageFlagBits) specifying
the shader stages that will use the descriptors.

* 
`layout` is a [VkPipelineLayout](#VkPipelineLayout) object used to program the
bindings.
If the [`dynamicPipelineLayout`](features.html#features-dynamicPipelineLayout)
feature is enabled, `layout` **can** be [VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE) and the
layout **must** be specified by chaining [VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo](#VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo)
structure off the `pNext`

* 
`set` is the set number of the descriptor set in the pipeline layout
that will be updated.

* 
`descriptorWriteCount` is the number of elements in the
`pDescriptorWrites` array.

* 
`pDescriptorWrites` is a pointer to an array of
[VkWriteDescriptorSet](#VkWriteDescriptorSet) structures describing the descriptors to be
updated.

If `stageFlags` specifies a subset of all stages corresponding to one or
more pipeline bind points, the binding operation still affects all stages
corresponding to the given pipeline bind point(s) as if the equivalent
original version of this command had been called with the same parameters.
For example, specifying a `stageFlags` value of
`VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT` | `VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT` |
`VK_SHADER_STAGE_COMPUTE_BIT` is equivalent to calling the original
version of this command once with `VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS` and
once with `VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE`.

As described above in section [Pipeline Layouts](#descriptorsets-pipelinelayout), the pipeline layout defines shader push constants which are
updated via Vulkan commands rather than via writes to memory or copy
commands.

|  | Push constants represent a high speed path to modify constant data in
| --- | --- |
pipelines that is expected to outperform memory-backed resource updates. |

To update push constants, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
void vkCmdPushConstants(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkPipelineLayout                            layout,
    VkShaderStageFlags                          stageFlags,
    uint32_t                                    offset,
    uint32_t                                    size,
    const void*                                 pValues);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer in which the push constant
update will be recorded.

* 
`layout` is the pipeline layout used to program the push constant
updates.

* 
`stageFlags` is a bitmask of [VkShaderStageFlagBits](pipelines.html#VkShaderStageFlagBits) specifying
the shader stages that will use the push constants in the updated range.

* 
`offset` is the start offset of the push constant range to update,
in units of bytes.

* 
`size` is the size of the push constant range to update, in units of
bytes.

* 
`pValues` is a pointer to an array of `size` bytes containing
the new push constant values.

When a command buffer begins recording, all push constant values are
**undefined**.
Reads of **undefined** push constant values by the executing shader return
**undefined** values.

Push constant values **can** be updated incrementally, causing shader stages in
`stageFlags` to read the new data from `pValues` for push constants
modified by this command, while still reading the previous data for push
constants not modified by this command.
When a [bound pipeline command](pipelines.html#pipelines-bindpoint-commands) is issued,
the bound pipeline’s layout **must** be compatible with the layouts used to set
the values of all push constants in the pipeline layout’s push constant
ranges, as described in [Pipeline Layout Compatibility](#descriptorsets-compatibility).
Binding a pipeline with a layout that is not compatible with the push
constant layout does not disturb the push constant values.

|  | As `stageFlags` needs to include all flags the relevant push constant
| --- | --- |
ranges were created with, any flags that are not supported by the queue
family that the [VkCommandPool](cmdbuffers.html#VkCommandPool) used to allocate `commandBuffer` was
created on are ignored. |

To query a 64-bit buffer device address value through which buffer memory
**can** be accessed in a shader, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2

    const VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo*            pInfo);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_buffer_device_address
VkDeviceAddress vkGetBufferDeviceAddressKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo*            pInfo);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_EXT_buffer_device_address
VkDeviceAddress vkGetBufferDeviceAddressEXT(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo*            pInfo);

* 
`device` is the logical device that the buffer was created on.

* 
`pInfo` is a pointer to a [VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo](#VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo) structure
specifying the buffer to retrieve an address for.

The 64-bit return value is an address of the start of `pInfo->buffer`.
The address range starting at this value and whose size is the size of the
buffer **can** be used in a shader to access the memory bound to that buffer,
using the
`SPV_KHR_physical_storage_buffer` extension
or the equivalent
`SPV_EXT_physical_storage_buffer` extension
and the `PhysicalStorageBuffer` storage class.
For example, this value **can** be stored in a uniform buffer, and the shader
**can** read the value from the uniform buffer and use it to do a dependent
read/write to this buffer.
A value of zero is reserved as a “null” pointer and **must** not be returned
as a valid buffer device address.
All loads, stores, and atomics in a shader through
`PhysicalStorageBuffer` pointers **must** access addresses in the address
range of some buffer.

If the buffer was created with a non-zero value of
[VkBufferOpaqueCaptureAddressCreateInfo](resources.html#VkBufferOpaqueCaptureAddressCreateInfo)::`opaqueCaptureAddress` or
[VkBufferDeviceAddressCreateInfoEXT](resources.html#VkBufferDeviceAddressCreateInfoEXT)::`deviceAddress`,
the return value will be the same address that was returned at capture time.

The returned address **must** satisfy the alignment requirement specified by
[VkMemoryRequirements](resources.html#VkMemoryRequirements)::`alignment` for the buffer in
[VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo](#VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo)::`buffer`.

If multiple [VkBuffer](resources.html#VkBuffer) objects are bound to overlapping ranges of
[VkDeviceMemory](memory.html#VkDeviceMemory), implementations **may** return address ranges which
overlap.
In this case, it is ambiguous which [VkBuffer](resources.html#VkBuffer) is associated with any
given device address.
For purposes of valid usage, if multiple [VkBuffer](resources.html#VkBuffer) objects **can** be
attributed to a device address, a [VkBuffer](resources.html#VkBuffer) is selected such that valid
usage passes, if it exists.

If the [`descriptorBuffer`](features.html#features-descriptorBuffer) feature is
enabled, an alternative way to specify descriptor sets is via buffers,
rather than descriptor set objects.

Commands are provided to retrieve descriptor data, and also to locate where
in memory that data **must** be written to match the given descriptor set
layout.

To determine the amount of memory needed to store all descriptors with a
given layout, call:

// Provided by VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer
void vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutSizeEXT(
    VkDevice                                    device,

    VkDeviceSize*                               pLayoutSizeInBytes);

* 
`device` is the logical device that gets the size.

* 
`layout` is the descriptor set layout being queried.

* 
`pLayoutSizeInBytes` is a pointer to `VkDeviceSize` where the
size in bytes will be written.

The size of a descriptor set layout will be at least as large as the sum
total of the size of all descriptors in the layout, and **may** be larger.
This size represents the amount of memory that will be required to store all
of the descriptors for this layout in memory, when placed according to the
layout’s offsets as obtained by
[vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutBindingOffsetEXT](#vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutBindingOffsetEXT).

If any `binding` in `layout` is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_VARIABLE_DESCRIPTOR_COUNT_BIT`, the returned size
includes space for the maximum `descriptorCount` descriptors as declared
for that `binding`.
To compute the required size of a descriptor set with a
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_VARIABLE_DESCRIPTOR_COUNT_BIT`:

size = offset + descriptorSize ×
variableDescriptorCount

where offset is obtained by
[vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutBindingOffsetEXT](#vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutBindingOffsetEXT) and descriptorSize is
the size of the relevant descriptor as obtained from
[VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT](limits.html#VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT), and
variableDescriptorCount is the equivalent of
[VkDescriptorSetVariableDescriptorCountAllocateInfo](#VkDescriptorSetVariableDescriptorCountAllocateInfo)::`pDescriptorCounts`.
For `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK`,
variableDescriptorCount is the size in bytes for the inline uniform
block, and descriptorSize is 1.

If
[VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT](limits.html#VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT)::`combinedImageSamplerDescriptorSingleArray`
is `VK_FALSE` and the variable descriptor type is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER`,
variableDescriptorCount is always considered to be the upper bound.

call:

// Provided by VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer
void vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutBindingOffsetEXT(

    VkDescriptorSetLayout                       layout,
    uint32_t                                    binding,
    VkDeviceSize*                               pOffset);

* 
`device` is the logical device that gets the offset.

* 
`layout` is the descriptor set layout being queried.

* 
`binding` is the binding number being queried.

* 
`pOffset` is a pointer to `VkDeviceSize` where the byte
offset of the binding will be written.

Each binding in a descriptor set layout is assigned an offset in memory by
the implementation.
When a shader accesses a resource with that binding, it will access the
bound descriptor buffer from that offset to look for its descriptor.
This command provides an application with that offset, so that descriptors
can be placed in the correct locations.
The precise location accessed by a shader for a given descriptor is as
follows:

location = bufferAddress +  setOffset + 
descriptorOffset +  (arrayElement × descriptorSize)

where bufferAddress and setOffset are the base address and
offset for the identified descriptor set as specified by
[vkCmdBindDescriptorBuffersEXT](#vkCmdBindDescriptorBuffersEXT) and
[vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT](#vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT), descriptorOffset is the
offset for the binding returned by this command, arrayElement is the
index into the array specified in the shader, and descriptorSize is
the size of the relevant descriptor as obtained from
[VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT](limits.html#VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT).
Applications are responsible for placing valid descriptors at the expected
location in order for a shader to access it.
The overall offset added to bufferAddress to calculate location
**must** be less than
[VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT](limits.html#VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT)::`maxSamplerDescriptorBufferRange`
for samplers and
[VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT](limits.html#VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT)::`maxResourceDescriptorBufferRange`
for resources.

If any `binding` in `layout` is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_VARIABLE_DESCRIPTOR_COUNT_BIT`, that
`binding` **must** have the largest offset of any `binding`.

A descriptor `binding` with type `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_VALVE`
**can** be used.
Any potential types in
[VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoVALVE](#VkMutableDescriptorTypeCreateInfoVALVE)::`pDescriptorTypes` for
`binding` share the same offset.
If the size of the [mutable descriptor](#descriptorsets-mutable) is larger
than the size of a concrete descriptor type being accessed, the padding area
is ignored by the implementation.

To get descriptor data to place in a buffer, call:

// Provided by VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer
void vkGetDescriptorEXT(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkDescriptorGetInfoEXT*               pDescriptorInfo,
    size_t                                      dataSize,
    void*                                       pDescriptor);

* 
`device` is the logical device that gets the descriptor.

* 
`pDescriptorInfo` is a pointer to a [VkDescriptorGetInfoEXT](#VkDescriptorGetInfoEXT)
structure specifying the parameters of the descriptor to get.

* 
`dataSize` is the amount of the descriptor data to get in bytes.

* 
`pDescriptor` is a pointer to an application-allocated buffer where
the descriptor will be written.

The size of the data for each descriptor type is determined by the value in
[VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT](limits.html#VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT).
This value also defines the stride in bytes for arrays of that descriptor
type.

If the
[VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT](limits.html#VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT)::`combinedImageSamplerDescriptorSingleArray`
property is `VK_FALSE` the implementation requires an array of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER` descriptors to be written
into a descriptor buffer as an array of image descriptors, immediately
followed by an array of sampler descriptors.
Applications **must** write the first
[VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT](limits.html#VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT)::`sampledImageDescriptorSize`
bytes of the data returned through `pDescriptor` to the first array, and
the remaining
[VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT](limits.html#VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT)::`samplerDescriptorSize`
bytes of the data to the second array.
For variable-sized descriptor bindings of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER` descriptors, the two arrays
each have a size equal to the upper bound `descriptorCount` of that
binding.

A descriptor obtained by this command references the underlying
[VkImageView](resources.html#VkImageView) or [VkSampler](samplers.html#VkSampler), and these objects **must** not be
destroyed before the last time a descriptor is dynamically accessed.
For descriptor types which consume an address instead of an object, the
underlying [VkBuffer](resources.html#VkBuffer) is referenced instead.

Data describing a `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER`,
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER`,
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER`, or
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER` descriptor is passed in a

Immutable samplers specified in a descriptor set layout through
`pImmutableSamplers` **must** be provided by applications when obtaining
descriptor data.
Immutable samplers written in a descriptor buffer **must** have identical
parameters to the immutable samplers in the descriptor set layout that
consumes the sampler.

|  | If the descriptor set layout was created with
| --- | --- |
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_SET_LAYOUT_CREATE_EMBEDDED_IMMUTABLE_SAMPLERS_BIT_EXT`,
there is no buffer backing for the immutable sampler, so this requirement
does not exist.
The implementation handles allocation of these descriptors internally. |

|  | As descriptors are now in regular memory, drivers cannot hide copies of
| --- | --- |
immutable samplers that end up in descriptor sets from the application.
As such, applications are required to provide these samplers as if they were
not provided immutably. |

Descriptor buffers have their own separate binding point on the command
buffer, with buffers bound using [vkCmdBindDescriptorBuffersEXT](#vkCmdBindDescriptorBuffersEXT).
[vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT](#vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT) assigns pairs of buffer binding
indices and buffer offsets to the same binding point on the command buffer
as [vkCmdBindDescriptorSets](#vkCmdBindDescriptorSets), allowing subsequent
[bound pipeline commands](pipelines.html#pipelines-bindpoint-commands) to use the
specified descriptor buffers.
Bindings applied via [vkCmdBindDescriptorSets](#vkCmdBindDescriptorSets) **cannot** exist
simultaneously with those applied via calls to
[vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT](#vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT) or
[vkCmdBindDescriptorBufferEmbeddedSamplersEXT](#vkCmdBindDescriptorBufferEmbeddedSamplersEXT), as calls to
[vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT](#vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT) or
[vkCmdBindDescriptorBufferEmbeddedSamplersEXT](#vkCmdBindDescriptorBufferEmbeddedSamplersEXT) invalidate any bindings
by previous calls to [vkCmdBindDescriptorSets](#vkCmdBindDescriptorSets) and vice-versa.

To bind descriptor buffers to a command buffer, call:

// Provided by VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer
void vkCmdBindDescriptorBuffersEXT(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    bufferCount,
    const VkDescriptorBufferBindingInfoEXT*     pBindingInfos);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer that the descriptor buffers
will be bound to.

* 
`bufferCount` is the number of elements in the `pBindingInfos`
array.

* 
`pBindingInfos` is a pointer to an array of
[VkDescriptorBufferBindingInfoEXT](#VkDescriptorBufferBindingInfoEXT) structures.

`vkCmdBindDescriptorBuffersEXT` causes any offsets previously set by
[vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT](#vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT) that use the bindings numbered
[`0`..
`bufferCount`-1] to be no longer valid for subsequent bound pipeline
commands.
Any previously bound buffers at binding points greater than or equal to
`bufferCount` are unbound.

void vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT(

    VkPipelineBindPoint                         pipelineBindPoint,

    const VkDeviceSize*                         pOffsets);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer in which the descriptor buffer
offsets will be set.

* 
`pipelineBindPoint` is a [VkPipelineBindPoint](pipelines.html#VkPipelineBindPoint) indicating the
type of the pipeline that will use the descriptors.

* 
`layout` is a [VkPipelineLayout](#VkPipelineLayout) object used to program the
bindings.

* 
`firstSet` is the number of the first set to be bound.

* 
`setCount` is the number of elements in the `pBufferIndices` and
`pOffsets` arrays.

* 
`pBufferIndices` is a pointer to an array of indices into the
descriptor buffer binding points set by
[vkCmdBindDescriptorBuffersEXT](#vkCmdBindDescriptorBuffersEXT).

* 
`pOffsets` is a pointer to an array of `VkDeviceSize` offsets
to apply to the bound descriptor buffers.

`vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsEXT` binds `setCount` pairs of
descriptor buffers, specified by indices into the binding points bound using
[vkCmdBindDescriptorBuffersEXT](#vkCmdBindDescriptorBuffersEXT), and buffer offsets to set numbers
[`firstSet`..`firstSet`+`descriptorSetCount`-1] for subsequent
[bound pipeline commands](pipelines.html#pipelines-bindpoint-commands) set by
`pipelineBindPoint`.
Set [`firstSet` + i] is bound to the descriptor buffer at binding
`pBufferIndices`[i] at an offset of `pOffsets`[i].
Any bindings that were previously applied via these sets, or calls to
[vkCmdBindDescriptorSets](#vkCmdBindDescriptorSets), are no longer valid.
Other sets will also be invalidated upon calling this command if
`layout` differs from the pipeline layout used to bind those other sets,
as described in [Pipeline Layout Compatibility](#descriptorsets-compatibility).

After binding descriptors, applications **can** modify descriptor memory either
by performing writes on the host or with device commands.
When descriptor memory is updated with device commands, visibility for the
shader stage accessing a descriptor is ensured with the
`VK_ACCESS_2_DESCRIPTOR_BUFFER_READ_BIT_EXT` access flag.
Implementations **must** not access resources referenced by these descriptors
unless they are dynamically accessed by shaders.
Descriptors bound with this call **can** be **undefined** if they are not
dynamically accessed by shaders.

Implementations **may** read descriptor data for any statically accessed
descriptor if the `binding` in `layout` is not declared with the
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_VARIABLE_DESCRIPTOR_COUNT_BIT` flag.
If the `binding` in `layout` is declared with
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_VARIABLE_DESCRIPTOR_COUNT_BIT`, implementations
**must** not read descriptor data that is not dynamically accessed.

Applications **must** ensure that any descriptor which the implementation **may**
read **must** be in-bounds of the underlying descriptor buffer binding.

|  | Applications can freely decide how large a variable descriptor buffer
| --- | --- |
binding is, so it may not be safe to read such descriptor payloads
statically.
The intention of these rules is to allow implementations to speculatively
prefetch descriptor payloads where feasible. |

Dynamically accessing a resource through descriptor data from an unbound
region of a [sparse partially-resident buffer](sparsemem.html#sparsememory-partially-resident-buffers) will result in invalid descriptor data being
read, and therefore **undefined** behavior.

|  | For descriptors written by the host, visibility is implied through the
| --- | --- |
automatic visibility operation on queue submit, and there is no need to
consider `VK_ACCESS_2_DESCRIPTOR_BUFFER_READ_BIT`.
Explicit synchronization for descriptors is only required when descriptors
are updated on the device. |

|  | The requirements above imply that all descriptor bindings have been defined
| --- | --- |
with the equivalent of `VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT`,
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_UNUSED_WHILE_PENDING_BIT` and
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_PARTIALLY_BOUND_BIT`, but enabling those features
is not required to get this behavior. |

Alternatively, to set descriptor buffer offsets in a command buffer, call:

// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance6 with VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer
void vkCmdSetDescriptorBufferOffsets2EXT(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,

The `VkSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsInfoEXT` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance6 with VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer
typedef struct VkSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsInfoEXT {
    VkStructureType        sType;
    const void*            pNext;
    VkShaderStageFlags     stageFlags;
    VkPipelineLayout       layout;
    uint32_t               firstSet;
    uint32_t               setCount;
    const uint32_t*        pBufferIndices;
    const VkDeviceSize*    pOffsets;
} VkSetDescriptorBufferOffsetsInfoEXT;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`stageFlags` is a bitmask of [VkShaderStageFlagBits](pipelines.html#VkShaderStageFlagBits) specifying
the shader stages the descriptor sets will be bound to

* 
`layout` is a [VkPipelineLayout](#VkPipelineLayout) object used to program the
bindings.
If the [`dynamicPipelineLayout`](features.html#features-dynamicPipelineLayout)
feature is enabled, `layout` **can** be [VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE) and the
layout **must** be specified by chaining [VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo](#VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo)
structure off the `pNext`

* 
`firstSet` is the number of the first set to be bound.

* 
`setCount` is the number of elements in the `pBufferIndices` and
`pOffsets` arrays.

* 
`pBufferIndices` is a pointer to an array of indices into the
descriptor buffer binding points set by
[vkCmdBindDescriptorBuffersEXT](#vkCmdBindDescriptorBuffersEXT).

* 
`pOffsets` is a pointer to an array of `VkDeviceSize` offsets
to apply to the bound descriptor buffers.

If `stageFlags` specifies a subset of all stages corresponding to one or
more pipeline bind points, the binding operation still affects all stages
corresponding to the given pipeline bind point(s) as if the equivalent
original version of this command had been called with the same parameters.
For example, specifying a `stageFlags` value of
`VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT` | `VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT` |
`VK_SHADER_STAGE_COMPUTE_BIT` is equivalent to calling the original
version of this command once with `VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS` and
once with `VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE`.

For example, specifying a `stageFlags` value of

Updates to descriptor data in buffers **can** be performed by any operation on
either the host or device that **can** access memory.

Descriptor buffer reads **can** be synchronized using
`VK_ACCESS_2_DESCRIPTOR_BUFFER_READ_BIT_EXT` in the relevant shader
stage.

If the [`descriptorBufferPushDescriptors`](features.html#features-descriptorBufferPushDescriptors) feature is enabled, push descriptors
**can** be used with descriptor buffers in the same way as with descriptor
sets.

The [`VkPhysicalDeviceDescriptorBufferPropertiesEXT`::`bufferlessPushDescriptors`](limits.html#limits-bufferlessPushDescriptors)
property indicates whether the implementation requires a buffer to back push
descriptors.
If the property is `VK_FALSE` then before recording any push descriptors
the application **must** bind exactly `1` descriptor buffer that was created
with the `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_PUSH_DESCRIPTORS_DESCRIPTOR_BUFFER_BIT_EXT`
bit set.
When this buffer is bound any previously recorded push descriptors that are
required for a subsequent command **must** be recorded again.

In a similar way to [`bufferDeviceAddressCaptureReplay`](features.html#features-bufferDeviceAddressCaptureReplay), the
[`descriptorBufferCaptureReplay`](features.html#features-descriptorBufferCaptureReplay) feature allows the creation of opaque
handles for objects at capture time that **can** be passed into object creation
calls in a future replay, causing descriptors to be created with the same
data.
The opaque memory address for any memory used by these resources **must** have
been captured using [vkGetDeviceMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddress](memory.html#vkGetDeviceMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddress) and be
replayed using [VkMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddressAllocateInfo](memory.html#VkMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddressAllocateInfo).

To get the opaque descriptor data for a buffer, call:

// Provided by VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer
VkResult vkGetBufferOpaqueCaptureDescriptorDataEXT(
    VkDevice                                    device,

    void*                                       pData);

* 
`device` is the logical device that gets the data.

* 
`pInfo` is a pointer to a [VkBufferCaptureDescriptorDataInfoEXT](#VkBufferCaptureDescriptorDataInfoEXT)
structure specifying the buffer.
