## Content

Drawing commands (commands with Draw in the name) provoke work in a graphics pipeline. Drawing commands are recorded into a command buffer and when executed by a queue, will produce work which executes according to the bound graphics pipeline, or if the shaderObject feature is enabled, any shader objects bound to graphics stages. A graphics pipeline or a combination of one or more graphics shader objects must be bound to a command buffer before any drawing commands are recorded in that command buffer. Drawing can be achieved in two modes: Programmable Mesh Shading, the mesh shader assembles primitives, or Programmable Primitive Shading, the input primitives are assembled as follows. Each draw is made up of zero or more vertices and zero or more instances, which are processed by the device and result in the assembly of primitives. Primitives are assembled according to the pInputAssemblyState member of the VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo structure, which is of type VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef struct VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateFlags flags; VkPrimitiveTopology topology; VkBool32 primitiveRestartEnable; } VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. flags is reserved for future use. topology is a VkPrimitiveTopology defining the primitive topology, as described below. primitiveRestartEnable controls whether a special vertex index value is treated as restarting the assembly of primitives. This enable only applies to indexed draws (vkCmdDrawIndexed, vkCmdDrawMultiIndexedEXT, and vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect), and the special index value is either 0xFFFFFFFF when the indexType parameter of Vulkan 1.4 or vkCmdBindIndexBuffer2 or vkCmdBindIndexBuffer is equal to VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT32; 0xFF when indexType is equal to VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT8; or 0xFFFF when indexType is equal to VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT16. Primitive restart is not allowed for “list” topologies, unless one of the features primitiveTopologyPatchListRestart (for VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_PATCH_LIST) or primitiveTopologyListRestart (for all other list topologies) is enabled. Restarting the assembly of primitives discards the most recent index values if those elements formed an incomplete primitive, and restarts the primitive assembly using the subsequent indices, but only assembling the immediately following element through the end of the originally specified elements. The primitive restart index value comparison is performed before adding the vertexOffset value to the index value. Valid Usage VUID-VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo-topology-06252 If the primitiveTopologyListRestart feature is not enabled, and topology is VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_POINT_LIST, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_LIST, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_LIST_WITH_ADJACENCY, or VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST_WITH_ADJACENCY, primitiveRestartEnable must be VK_FALSE VUID-VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo-topology-06253 If the primitiveTopologyPatchListRestart feature is not enabled, and topology is VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_PATCH_LIST, primitiveRestartEnable must be VK_FALSE VUID-VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo-topology-00429 If the geometryShader feature is not enabled, topology must not be any of VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_LIST_WITH_ADJACENCY, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_STRIP_WITH_ADJACENCY, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST_WITH_ADJACENCY or VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_STRIP_WITH_ADJACENCY VUID-VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo-topology-00430 If the tessellationShader feature is not enabled, topology must not be VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_PATCH_LIST VUID-VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo-triangleFans-04452 If the VK_KHR_portability_subset extension is enabled, and VkPhysicalDevicePortabilitySubsetFeaturesKHR::triangleFans is VK_FALSE, topology must not be VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_FAN Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo-sType-sType sType must be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_INPUT_ASSEMBLY_STATE_CREATE_INFO VUID-VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo-pNext-pNext pNext must be NULL VUID-VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo-flags-zerobitmask flags must be 0 VUID-VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo-topology-parameter topology must be a valid VkPrimitiveTopology value // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef VkFlags VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateFlags; VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateFlags is a bitmask type for setting a mask, but is currently reserved for future use. To dynamically control whether a special vertex index value is treated as restarting the assembly of primitives, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3 void vkCmdSetPrimitiveRestartEnable( VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, VkBool32 primitiveRestartEnable); or the equivalent command // Provided by VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2, VK_EXT_shader_object void vkCmdSetPrimitiveRestartEnableEXT( VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, VkBool32 primitiveRestartEnable); commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be recorded. primitiveRestartEnable controls whether a special vertex index value is treated as restarting the assembly of primitives. It behaves in the same way as VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo::primitiveRestartEnable This command sets the primitive restart enable for subsequent drawing commands when drawing using shader objects, or when the graphics pipeline is created with VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_PRIMITIVE_RESTART_ENABLE set in VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo::pDynamicStates. Otherwise, this state is specified by the VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo::primitiveRestartEnable value used to create the currently active pipeline. Valid Usage VUID-vkCmdSetPrimitiveRestartEnable-None-08970 At least one of the following must be true: the extendedDynamicState2 feature is enabled the shaderObject feature is enabled the value of VkApplicationInfo::apiVersion used to create the VkInstance parent of commandBuffer is greater than or equal to Version 1.3 Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-vkCmdSetPrimitiveRestartEnable-commandBuffer-parameter commandBuffer must be a valid VkCommandBuffer handle VUID-vkCmdSetPrimitiveRestartEnable-commandBuffer-recording commandBuffer must be in the recording state VUID-vkCmdSetPrimitiveRestartEnable-commandBuffer-cmdpool The VkCommandPool that commandBuffer was allocated from must support graphics operations VUID-vkCmdSetPrimitiveRestartEnable-videocoding This command must only be called outside of a video coding scope Host Synchronization Host access to commandBuffer must be externally synchronized Host access to the VkCommandPool that commandBuffer was allocated from must be externally synchronized Command Properties Command Buffer Levels Render Pass Scope Video Coding Scope Supported Queue Types Command Type Primary Secondary Both Outside Graphics State Primitive topology determines how consecutive vertices are organized into primitives, and determines the type of primitive that is used at the beginning of the graphics pipeline. The effective topology for later stages of the pipeline is altered by tessellation or geometry shading (if either is in use) and depends on the execution modes of those shaders. In the case of mesh shading the only effective topology is defined by the execution mode of the mesh shader. The primitive topologies defined by VkPrimitiveTopology are: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 typedef enum VkPrimitiveTopology { VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_POINT_LIST = 0, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_LIST = 1, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_STRIP = 2, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST = 3, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_STRIP = 4, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_FAN = 5, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_LIST_WITH_ADJACENCY = 6, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_STRIP_WITH_ADJACENCY = 7, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST_WITH_ADJACENCY = 8, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_STRIP_WITH_ADJACENCY = 9, VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_PATCH_LIST = 10, } VkPrimitiveTopology; VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_POINT_LIST specifies a series of separate point primitives. VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_LIST specifies a series of separate line primitives. VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_STRIP specifies a series of connected line primitives with consecutive lines sharing a vertex. VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST specifies a series of separate triangle primitives. VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_STRIP specifies a series of connected triangle primitives with consecutive triangles sharing an edge. VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_FAN specifies a series of connected triangle primitives with all triangles sharing a common vertex. If the VK_KHR_portability_subset extension is enabled, and VkPhysicalDevicePortabilitySubsetFeaturesKHR::triangleFans is VK_FALSE, then triangle fans are not supported by the implementation, and VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_FAN must not be used. VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_LIST_WITH_ADJACENCY specifies a series of separate line primitives with adjacency. VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_STRIP_WITH_ADJACENCY specifies a series of connected line primitives with adjacency, with consecutive primitives sharing three vertices. VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST_WITH_ADJACENCY specifies a series of separate triangle primitives with adjacency. VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_STRIP_WITH_ADJACENCY specifies connected triangle primitives with adjacency, with consecutive triangles sharing an edge. VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_PATCH_LIST specifies separate patch primitives. Each primitive topology, and its construction from a list of vertices, is described in detail below with a supporting diagram, according to the following key: Vertex A point in 3-dimensional space. Positions chosen within the diagrams are arbitrary and for illustration only. Vertex Number Sequence position of a vertex within the provided vertex data. Provoking Vertex Provoking vertex within the main primitive. The tail is angled towards the relevant primitive. Used in flat shading. Primitive Edge An edge connecting the points of a main primitive. Adjacency Edge Points connected by these lines do not contribute to a main primitive, and are only accessible in a geometry shader. Winding Order The relative order in which vertices are defined within a primitive, used in the facing determination. This ordering has no specific start or end point. The diagrams are supported with mathematical definitions where the vertices (v) and primitives (p) are numbered starting from 0; v0 is the first vertex in the provided data and p0 is the first primitive in the set of primitives defined by the vertices and topology. To dynamically set primitive topology, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3 void vkCmdSetPrimitiveTopology( VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, VkPrimitiveTopology primitiveTopology); or the equivalent command // Provided by VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state, VK_EXT_shader_object void vkCmdSetPrimitiveTopologyEXT( VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, VkPrimitiveTopology primitiveTopology); commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be recorded. primitiveTopology specifies the primitive topology to use for drawing. This command sets the primitive topology for subsequent drawing commands when drawing using shader objects, or when the graphics pipeline is created with VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY set in VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo::pDynamicStates. Otherwise, this state is specified by the VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo::topology value used to create the currently active pipeline.

Command Type Primary Secondary Inside Outside Graphics Action To record an indexed draw, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0 void vkCmdDrawIndexed( VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, uint32_t indexCount, uint32_t instanceCount, uint32_t firstIndex, int32_t vertexOffset, uint32_t firstInstance); commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command is recorded. indexCount is the number of vertices to draw. instanceCount is the number of instances to draw. firstIndex is the base index within the index buffer. vertexOffset is the value added to the vertex index before indexing into the vertex buffer. firstInstance is the instance ID of the first instance to draw. When the command is executed, primitives are assembled using the current primitive topology and indexCount vertices whose indices are retrieved from the index buffer. The index buffer is treated as an array of tightly packed unsigned integers of size defined by the vkCmdBindIndexBuffer2::indexType or the vkCmdBindIndexBuffer::indexType parameter with which the buffer was bound. The first vertex index is at an offset of firstIndex × indexSize + offset within the bound index buffer, where offset is the offset specified by vkCmdBindIndexBuffer or vkCmdBindIndexBuffer2, and indexSize is the byte size of the type specified by indexType. Subsequent index values are retrieved from consecutive locations in the index buffer. Indices are first compared to the primitive restart value, then zero extended to 32 bits (if the indexType is VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT8 or VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT16) and have vertexOffset added to them, before being supplied as the vertexIndex value. The primitives are drawn instanceCount times with instanceIndex starting with firstInstance and increasing sequentially for each instance. The assembled primitives execute the bound graphics pipeline.

A pipeline barrier is required between using the counter buffer for vkCmdEndTransformFeedbackEXT and vkCmdDrawIndirectByteCountEXT where the source access is VK_ACCESS_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_COUNTER_WRITE_BIT_EXT and the destination access is VK_ACCESS_INDIRECT_COMMAND_READ_BIT for the pipeline stages VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BIT_EXT and VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_DRAW_INDIRECT_BIT respectively. To record a non-indexed draw call, where the vertex count is based on a byte count read from a buffer and the passed in vertex stride parameter, call: // Provided by VK_EXT_transform_feedback void vkCmdDrawIndirectByteCountEXT( VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, uint32_t instanceCount, uint32_t firstInstance, VkBuffer counterBuffer, VkDeviceSize counterBufferOffset, uint32_t counterOffset, uint32_t vertexStride); commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command is recorded. instanceCount is the number of instances to draw. firstInstance is the instance ID of the first instance to draw. counterBuffer is the buffer handle from where the byte count is read. counterBufferOffset is the offset into the buffer used to read the byte count, which is used to calculate the vertex count for this draw call. counterOffset is subtracted from the byte count read from the counterBuffer at the counterBufferOffset vertexStride is the stride in bytes between each element of the vertex data that is used to calculate the vertex count from the counter value. This value is typically the same value that was used in the graphics pipeline state when the transform feedback was captured as the XfbStride. When the command is executed, primitives are assembled in the same way as done with vkCmdDraw except the vertexCount is calculated based on the byte count read from counterBuffer at offset counterBufferOffset. The assembled primitives execute the bound graphics pipeline. The effective vertexCount is calculated as follows: const uint32_t * counterBufferPtr = (const uint8_t *)counterBuffer.address + counterBufferOffset; vertexCount = floor(max(0, (*counterBufferPtr - counterOffset)) / vertexStride); The effective firstVertex is zero.

Pass Scope Video Coding Scope Supported Queue Types Command Type Primary Secondary Inside Outside Graphics Action Certain rendering commands can be executed conditionally based on a value in buffer memory. These rendering commands are limited to drawing commands, dispatching commands, and clearing attachments with vkCmdClearAttachments within a conditional rendering block which is defined by commands vkCmdBeginConditionalRenderingEXT and vkCmdEndConditionalRenderingEXT. Other rendering commands remain unaffected by conditional rendering. After beginning conditional rendering, it is considered active within the command buffer it was called until it is ended with vkCmdEndConditionalRenderingEXT. Conditional rendering must begin and end in the same command buffer. When conditional rendering is active, a primary command buffer can execute secondary command buffers if the inheritedConditionalRendering feature is enabled. For a secondary command buffer to be executed while conditional rendering is active in the primary command buffer, it must set the conditionalRenderingEnable flag of VkCommandBufferInheritanceConditionalRenderingInfoEXT, as described in the Command Buffer Recording section. Conditional rendering must also either begin and end inside the same subpass of a render pass instance, or must both begin and end outside of a render pass instance (i.e. contain entire render pass instances). To begin conditional rendering, call: // Provided by VK_EXT_conditional_rendering void vkCmdBeginConditionalRenderingEXT( VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, const VkConditionalRenderingBeginInfoEXT* pConditionalRenderingBegin); commandBuffer is the command buffer into which this command will be recorded. pConditionalRenderingBegin is a pointer to a VkConditionalRenderingBeginInfoEXT structure specifying parameters of conditional rendering.

If the 32-bit value at offset in buffer memory is zero, then the rendering commands are discarded, otherwise they are executed as normal. If the value of the predicate in buffer memory changes while conditional rendering is active, the rendering commands may be discarded in an implementation-dependent way. Some implementations may latch the value of the predicate upon beginning conditional rendering while others may read it before every rendering command.
