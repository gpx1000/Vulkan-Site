## Content

This shader type has an execution environment similar to that of a compute
shader, where a collection of shader invocations form a workgroup and
cooperate to perform coarse level geometry culling and LOD selection.
A shader invocation can emit a set of built-in output variables via a new
built-in function.
The cluster culling shader organizes these emitted variables into a drawing
command used by the subsequent rendering pipeline.

The only inputs available to the cluster culling shader are variables
identifying the specific workgroup and invocation.

If a cluster survives after culling in a cluster culling shader invocation,
a drawing command to draw this cluster should be emitted by this shader
invocation for further rendering processing.
There are two types of drawing command, indexed mode and non-indexed mode.
Both type of drawing commands consist of a set of built-in output variables
which have a similar definition to [VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand](../drawing.html#VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand) and
[VkDrawIndirectCommand](../drawing.html#VkDrawIndirectCommand) members.

Cluster culling shaders have the following built-in output variables:

* 
[built-in variable](../interfaces.html#interfaces-builtin-variables) `IndexCountHUAWEI`
is the number of vertices to draw.

* 
[built-in variable](../interfaces.html#interfaces-builtin-variables)
`VertexCountHUAWEI` is the number of vertices to draw.

* 
[built-in variable](../interfaces.html#interfaces-builtin-variables)
`InstanceCountHUAWEI` is the number of instances to draw.

* 
[built-in variable](../interfaces.html#interfaces-builtin-variables) `FirstIndexHUAWEI`
is the base index within the index buffer.

* 
[built-in variable](../interfaces.html#interfaces-builtin-variables)
`FirstVertexHUAWEI` is the index of the first vertex to draw

* 
[built-in variable](../interfaces.html#interfaces-builtin-variables)
`VertexOffsetHUAWEI` is the value added to the vertex index before
indexing into the vertex buffer.

* 
[built-in variable](../interfaces.html#interfaces-builtin-variables)
`FirstInstanceHUAWEI` is the instance ID of the first instance to
draw.

* 
[built-in variable](../interfaces.html#interfaces-builtin-variables) `ClusterIDHUAWEI`
is the index of cluster being rendered by this drawing command.
When cluster culling shader is enabled, `ClusterIDHUAWEI` will
replace `gl_DrawID` pass to vertex shader.

* 
[built-in variable](../interfaces.html#interfaces-builtin-variables)
`ClusterShadingRate` is the shading rate of cluster being rendered by
this drawing command.

* 
When a cluster culling shader is used, all output clusters generated by
`DispatchClusterHUAWEI`() in a given workgroup are passed to
subsequent pipeline stage before any cluster generated from subsequent
workgroup.

* 
In a workgroup, the order of output clusters generated by
`DispatchClusterHUAWEI`() is specified by the local invocation id,
from lower to higher values.

* 
If any cluster culling invocation in the workgroup does not call
`DispatchClusterHUAWEI`(), no cluster will be sent to the subsequent
rendering pipeline.

* 
Any cluster culling shader invocation may also call
`DispatchClusterHUAWEI`() many times as shown below:

// Cluster Culling Shader sample code:
        ......
    DispatchClusterHUAWEI();  // dispatch 0
        ......
    DispatchClusterHUAWEI();  // dispatch 1
        ......
    DispatchClusterHUAWEI();  // dispatch 2
        ......

In this case, the output sequence of clusters in a workgroup are specified
as shown below ( in case of 32 shader invocations in a workgroup):

1. shader invocation0.dispatch0
2. shader invocation1.dispatch0,
            ..........
32. shader invocation31.dispatch0
33. shader invocation0.dispatch1
34. shader invocation1.dispatch1
            ..........
64. shader invocation31.dispatch1
65. shader invocation0.dispatch2
66. shader invocation1.dispatch2
            ..........
96. shader Invocation31.dispatch2

Following guarantees are provided for the relative ordering of primitives
produced by a cluster culling shader, as they pertain to
[primitive order](../drawing.html#drawing-primitive-order).

* 
Limited guarantees are provided for the relative ordering of primitives
produced by a cluster culling shader, as they pertain to primitive
order.

* 
The order of primitives in a given cluster is specified by the content
of

`DispatchClusterHUAWEI`() with indexed output built-in variables,
vertices sourced from a lower index buffer addresses to higher
addresses.

* 
`DispatchClusterHUAWEI`() with non-indexed output built-in
variables, from vertices with a lower numbered vertexIndex to a higher
numbered vertexIndex.
