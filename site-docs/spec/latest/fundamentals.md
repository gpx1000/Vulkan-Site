## Content

This chapter introduces fundamental concepts including the Vulkan
architecture and execution model, API syntax, queues, pipeline
configurations, numeric representation, state and state queries, and the
different types of objects and shaders.
It provides a framework for interpreting more specific descriptions of
commands and behavior in the remainder of the Specification.

The Vulkan Specification assumes and requires: the following properties of
the host environment with respect to Vulkan implementations:

* 
The host **must** have runtime support for 8, 16, 32 and 64-bit signed and
unsigned twos-complement integers, all addressable at the granularity of
their size in bytes.

* 
The host **must** have runtime support for 32- and 64-bit floating-point
types satisfying the range and precision constraints in the
[Floating-Point Computation](#fundamentals-floating-point) section.

* 
The representation and endianness of these types on the host **must** match
the representation and endianness of the same types on every physical
device supported.

|  | Since a variety of data types and structures in Vulkan **may** be accessible by
| --- | --- |
both host and physical device operations, the implementation **should** be able
to access such data efficiently in both paths in order to facilitate writing
portable and performant applications. |

This section outlines the execution model of a Vulkan system.

Vulkan exposes one or more *devices*, each of which exposes one or more
*queues* which **may** process work asynchronously to one another.
The set of queues supported by a device is partitioned into *families*.
Each family supports one or more types of functionality and **may** contain
multiple queues with similar characteristics.
Queues within a single family are considered *compatible* with one another,
and work produced for a family of queues **can** be executed on any queue
within that family.
This specification defines the following types of functionality that queues
**may** support: graphics, compute,
video decode,
video encode,
protected memory management,
sparse memory management,
and transfer.

|  | A single device **may** report multiple similar queue families rather than, or
| --- | --- |
as well as, reporting multiple members of one or more of those families.
This indicates that while members of those families have similar
capabilities, they are *not* directly compatible with one another. |

Device memory is explicitly managed by the application.
Each device **may** advertise one or more heaps, representing different areas
of memory.
Memory heaps are either device-local or host-local, but are always visible
to the device.
Further detail about memory heaps is exposed via memory types available on
that heap.
Examples of memory areas that **may** be available on an implementation
include:

* 
*device-local* is memory that is physically connected to the device.

* 
*device-local, host visible* is device-local memory that is visible to
the host.

* 
*host-local, host visible* is memory that is local to the host and
visible to the device and host.

On other architectures, there **may** only be a single heap that **can** be used
for any purpose.

Vulkan queues provide an interface to the execution engines of a device.
Commands for these execution engines are recorded into command buffers ahead
of execution time, and then submitted to a queue for execution.
Once submitted to a queue, command buffers will begin and complete execution
without further application intervention, though the order of this execution
is dependent on a number of [implicit and explicit ordering constraints](synchronization.html#synchronization).

Work is submitted to queues using *queue submission commands* that typically
take the form `vkQueue*` (e.g. [vkQueueSubmit](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit)
, [vkQueueBindSparse](sparsemem.html#vkQueueBindSparse)
), and **can** take a list of semaphores upon which to wait before work begins
and a list of semaphores to signal once work has completed.
The work itself, as well as signaling and waiting on the semaphores are all
*queue operations*.
Queue submission commands return control to the application once queue
operations have been submitted - they do not wait for completion.

There are no implicit ordering constraints between queue operations on
different queues, or between queues and the host, so these **may** operate in
any order with respect to each other.
Explicit ordering constraints between different queues or with the host **can**
be expressed with [semaphores](synchronization.html#synchronization-semaphores) and
[fences](synchronization.html#synchronization-fences).

Command buffer submissions to a single queue respect
[submission order](synchronization.html#synchronization-submission-order) and other
[implicit ordering guarantees](synchronization.html#synchronization-implicit), but otherwise
**may** overlap or execute out of order.
Other types of batches and queue submissions against a single queue
(e.g. [sparse memory binding](sparsemem.html#sparsemem-memory-binding))
have no implicit ordering constraints with any other queue submission or
batch.
Additional explicit ordering constraints between queue submissions and
individual batches can be expressed with
[semaphores](synchronization.html#synchronization-semaphores) and
[fences](synchronization.html#synchronization-fences).

Before a fence or semaphore is signaled, it is guaranteed that any
previously submitted queue operations have completed execution, and that
memory writes from those queue operations are
[available](synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible) to future
queue operations.
Waiting on a signaled semaphore or fence guarantees that previous writes
that are available are also
[visible](synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible) to subsequent
commands.

Command buffer boundaries, both between primary command buffers of the same
or different batches or submissions as well as between primary and secondary
command buffers, do not introduce any additional ordering constraints.
In other words, submitting the set of command buffers (which **can** include
executing secondary command buffers) between any semaphore or fence
operations execute the recorded commands as if they had all been recorded
into a single primary command buffer, except that the current state is
[reset](cmdbuffers.html#commandbuffers-statereset) on each boundary.
Explicit ordering constraints **can** be expressed with [explicit synchronization primitives](synchronization.html#synchronization).

There are a few [implicit ordering guarantees](synchronization.html#synchronization-implicit)
between commands within a command buffer, but only covering a subset of
execution.
Additional explicit ordering constraints can be expressed with the various
[explicit synchronization primitives](synchronization.html#synchronization).

|  | Implementations have significant freedom to overlap execution of work
| --- | --- |
submitted to a queue, and this is common due to deep pipelining and
parallelism in Vulkan devices. |

Commands recorded in command buffers can perform actions, set state that
persists across commands, synchronize other commands, or indirectly launch
other commands, with some commands fulfilling several of these roles.
The “Command Properties” section for each such command lists which of
these roles the command takes:

Action

*Action commands* perform operations that can update values in memory.
E.g. [draw commands](drawing.html#drawing), [dispatch commands](dispatch.html#dispatch).

State

*State setting commands* update the current state of a command buffer,
affecting the operation of future action commands.

Synchronization

*Synchronization commands* impose ordering constraints on action commands,
by introducing explicit [execution and  memory dependencies](synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies).

Indirection

*Indirection commands* execute other commands which were not directly
recorded in the same command buffer.

|  | In the absence of explicit synchronization or [implicit ordering guarantees](synchronization.html#synchronization-implicit), action commands may overlap execution or
| --- | --- |
execute out of order, potentially leading to data races.
However, such reordering does not affect the current state observed by any
action command.
Each action command uses the state in effect at the point where the command
occurs in the command buffer, regardless of when it is executed. |

The devices, queues, and other entities in Vulkan are represented by Vulkan
objects.
At the API level, all objects are referred to by handles.
There are two classes of handles, dispatchable and non-dispatchable.
*Dispatchable* handle types are a pointer to an opaque type.
This pointer **may** be used by layers as part of intercepting API commands,
and thus each API command takes a dispatchable type as its first parameter.
Each object of a dispatchable type **must** have a unique handle value during
its lifetime.

*Non-dispatchable* handle types are a 64-bit integer type whose meaning is
implementation-dependent.
If the [`privateData`](features.html#features-privateData) feature is enabled for a
[VkDevice](devsandqueues.html#VkDevice), each object of a non-dispatchable type created on that
device **must** have a handle value that is unique among objects created on
that device, for the duration of the object’s lifetime.
Otherwise, non-dispatchable
handles **may** encode object information directly in the handle rather than
acting as a reference to an underlying object, and thus **may** not have unique
handle values.
If handle values are not unique, then destroying one such handle **must** not
cause identical handles of other types to become invalid, and **must** not
cause identical handles of the same type to become invalid if that handle
value has been created more times than it has been destroyed.

All objects created or allocated from a `VkDevice` (i.e. with a
`VkDevice` as the first parameter) are private to that device, and **must**
not be used on other devices.

Objects are created or allocated by `vkCreate*` and `vkAllocate*`
commands, respectively.
Once an object is created or allocated, its “structure” is considered to
be immutable, though the content of certain object types is still free to
change.
When an object is passed to another command, it **may** be accessed by the
implementation, which **may** include both read and write access unless
explicitly stated otherwise.
Objects are destroyed or freed by `vkDestroy*` and `vkFree*`
commands, respectively.

Objects that are allocated (rather than created) take resources from an
existing pool object or memory heap, and when freed return resources to that
pool or heap.
While object creation and destruction are generally expected to be
low-frequency occurrences during runtime, allocating and freeing objects
**can** occur at high frequency.
Pool objects help accommodate improved performance of the allocations and
frees.

Applications are responsible for managing the lifetimes of Vulkan objects
and memory passed into the Vulkan API.
The access semantics of different functions in the API follow a typical
pattern as laid out below, with any exceptions listed with the commands or
objects that have them.

Application-owned memory and Vulkan objects **may** be accessed at any time
during the execution of a command they are passed to.
Vulkan objects that device addresses are retrieved from **may** be accessed by
the implementation any time that memory backing the device address is
accessed.
Device addresses and
Vulkan objects passed in during the creation or allocation of another object
**may** be accessed by the implementation any time that the created/allocated
object is accessed unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Device addresses and
Vulkan objects passed to a recording command (`vkCmd*`) **may** be accessed
at any time during the execution of the command, when the command buffer is
subsequently recorded into another command buffer, during any subsequent
command that is recorded to either the command buffer or one it is recorded
into, or while the command buffer is in the [*pending state*](cmdbuffers.html#commandbuffers-lifecycle), unless explicitly stated otherwise.
If an application is using [deferred host operations](VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations/deferred_host_operations.html#deferred-host-operations) in a command, and that operation is successfully deferred,
objects and memory passed to that command **may** be accessed at any time until
the deferred operation is complete.
Some additional operations hold references to other objects or
application-owned memory beyond the duration of the command; in which case
the access semantics and lifetime of those references are described by that
command.

When destroying or freeing an object, implementations **must** not access any
memory or other objects that **may** otherwise be accessed when the object is
accessed.
Applications **can** free or destroy objects in any order, except that parent
objects **must** be freed only after all child objects are freed.
An object is the parent of another child object if the parent was used as
the first object parameter in the creation of the child.
Once an object is freed or destroyed it **must** not be accessed again, either
directly or via access through another object.
Applications **must** not free or destroy any object while it is being
accessed.

As defined above, the scope of object handles created or allocated from a
`VkDevice` is limited to that logical device.
Objects which are not in scope are said to be external.
To bring an external object into scope, an external handle **must** be exported
from the object in the source scope and imported into the destination scope.

|  | The scope of external handles and their associated resources **may** vary
| --- | --- |
according to their type, but they **can** generally be shared across process
and API boundaries. |

The mechanism by which Vulkan is made available to applications is platform-
or implementation- defined.
On many platforms the C interface described in this Specification is
provided by a shared library.
Since shared libraries can be changed independently of the applications that
use them, they present particular compatibility challenges, and this
Specification places some requirements on them.

Shared library implementations **must** use the default Application Binary
Interface (ABI) of the standard C compiler for the platform, or provide
customized API headers that cause application code to use the
implementation’s non-default ABI.
An ABI in this context means the size, alignment, and layout of C data
types; the procedure calling convention; and the naming convention for
shared library symbols corresponding to C functions.
Customizing the calling convention for a platform is usually accomplished by
defining [calling convention macros](../appendices/boilerplate.html#boilerplate-platform-specific-calling-conventions) appropriately in `vk_platform.h`.

On platforms where Vulkan is provided as a shared library, library symbols
beginning with “vk” and followed by a digit or uppercase letter are
reserved for use by the implementation.
Applications which use Vulkan **must** not provide definitions of these
symbols.
This allows the Vulkan shared library to be updated with additional symbols
for new API versions or extensions without causing symbol conflicts with
existing applications.

Shared library implementations **should** provide library symbols for commands
in the highest version of this Specification they support, and for
[Window System Integration](VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#wsi)
extensions relevant to the platform.
They **may** also provide library symbols for commands defined by additional
extensions.

|  | These requirements and recommendations are intended to allow implementors to
| --- | --- |
take advantage of platform-specific conventions for SDKs, ABIs, library
versioning mechanisms, etc.
while still minimizing the code changes necessary to port applications or
libraries between platforms.
Platform vendors, or providers of the *de facto* standard Vulkan shared
library for a platform, are encouraged to document what symbols the shared
library provides and how it will be versioned when new symbols are added.

Applications **should** only rely on shared library symbols for commands in the
minimum core version required by the application.
[vkGetInstanceProcAddr](initialization.html#vkGetInstanceProcAddr) and [vkGetDeviceProcAddr](initialization.html#vkGetDeviceProcAddr) **should** be used to
obtain function pointers for commands in core versions beyond the
application’s minimum required version. |

The Specification describes Vulkan commands as functions or procedures using
C99 syntax.
Language bindings for other languages such as C++ and JavaScript **may** allow
for stricter parameter passing, or object-oriented interfaces.

Vulkan uses the standard C types for the base type of scalar parameters
(e.g. types from ``), with exceptions described below, or
elsewhere in the text when appropriate:

`VkBool32` represents boolean `True` and `False` values, since C does
not have a sufficiently portable built-in boolean type:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef uint32_t VkBool32;

`VK_TRUE` represents a boolean **True** (unsigned integer 1) value, and
`VK_FALSE` a boolean **False** (unsigned integer 0) value.

All values returned from a Vulkan implementation in a `VkBool32` will
be either `VK_TRUE` or `VK_FALSE`.

Applications **must** not pass any other values than `VK_TRUE` or
`VK_FALSE` into a Vulkan implementation where a `VkBool32` is
expected.

`VK_TRUE` is a constant representing a `VkBool32` **True** value.

#define VK_TRUE                           1U

`VK_FALSE` is a constant representing a `VkBool32` **False** value.

#define VK_FALSE                          0U

`VkDeviceSize` represents device memory size and offset values:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef uint64_t VkDeviceSize;

`VkDeviceAddress` represents device buffer address values:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef uint64_t VkDeviceAddress;

Commands that create Vulkan objects are of the form `vkCreate*` and take
`Vk*CreateInfo` structures with the parameters needed to create the
object.
These Vulkan objects are destroyed with commands of the form
`vkDestroy*`.

The last in-parameter to each command that creates or destroys a Vulkan
object is `pAllocator`.
The `pAllocator` parameter **can** be a non-`NULL` value, in which case
allocations for the given object are delegated to an application provided
callback.
Refer to the [Memory Allocation](memory.html#memory-allocation) chapter for further
details.

Commands that allocate Vulkan objects owned by pool objects are of the form
`vkAllocate*`, and take `Vk*AllocateInfo` structures.
These Vulkan objects are freed with commands of the form `vkFree*`.
These objects do not take allocators; if host memory is needed, they will
use the allocator that was specified when their parent pool was created.

Commands are recorded into a command buffer by calling API commands of the
form `vkCmd*`.
Each such command **may** have different restrictions on where it **can** be used:
in a primary and/or secondary command buffer, inside and/or outside a render
pass, and in one or more of the supported queue types.
These restrictions are documented together with the definition of each such
command.

The *duration* of a Vulkan command refers to the interval between calling
the command and its return to the caller.

Information is retrieved from the implementation with commands of the form
`vkGet*` and `vkEnumerate*`.

Unless otherwise specified for an individual command, the results are
*invariant*; that is, they will remain unchanged when retrieved again by
calling the same command with the same parameters, so long as those
parameters themselves all remain valid.

Some query commands of the form `vkGet*` and `vkEnumerate*` enable
retrieving multiple results in the form of a return array.
Such commands typically have two pointer arguments as follows:

* 
An element count pointer pointing to an integer variable, conventionally
named as `p*Count` where `*` is the capitalized singular form of
the name of the retrieved values.

* 
A pointer to an array where the result array is retrieved,
conventionally named as `p*` where `*` is the capitalized plural
form of the name of the retrieved values.

If such commands are called with the array pointer set to `NULL`, then the
number of retrievable elements is returned in the variable pointed to by the
element count pointer.
Otherwise, the element count pointer **must** point to a variable set by the
application to the number of elements in the return array, and on return the
variable is overwritten with the number of elements actually written to the
return array.
If the input element count is less than the number of retrievable array
elements, the query will write only as many elements to the return array as
specified by the element count variable set by the application, and the
command will return `VK_INCOMPLETE` instead of `VK_SUCCESS`, to
indicate that not all retrievable array elements were returned.

|  | In practice, this means that applications will typically call such query
| --- | --- |
commands twice:

* 
First, with the array pointer set to `NULL`, to retrieve the number of
retrievable elements.

* 
Second, with the array pointer pointing to an application allocated
storage for at least as many elements as indicated by the variable
pointed to by the element count pointer, to retrieve at most as many of
the retrievable elements. |

Query commands that return one or more structures, regardless of whether
they return a single or an array of structures with or without a `pNext`
chain, **may** also contain arrays within those structures.
Such return arrays are typically defined in the form of two members as
follows:

* 
An integer value specifying the element count, conventionally named as
`*Count` where `*` is the singular form of the name of the
retrieved values.

* 
A pointer to an array where the result array is retrieved,
conventionally named as `p*` where `*` is the capitalized plural
form of the name of the retrieved values.

Analogously to query commands that return multiple results, if the command
is called with the array pointer member of the output structure in question
set to `NULL`, then the number of retrievable elements is returned in the
element count member of that output structure.
Otherwise, the element count **must** specify the number of elements in the
return array, and on return the element count member is overwritten with the
number of elements actually written to the return array.
If the input element count is less than the number of retrievable array
elements, the query will write only as many elements to the return array as
specified by the input element count, and the command will return
`VK_INCOMPLETE` instead of `VK_SUCCESS`, if the query command has a
[VkResult](#VkResult) return type, to indicate that not all retrievable array
elements were returned.

|  | Applications need to separately track the value they provided as the input
| --- | --- |
element count member for such arrays and compare those with the returned
element counts in order to determine whether the actually returned element
count is smaller than the size of the return array.
Another side effect of this is that it is impossible for the application to
determine if the number of retrievable elements has increased beyond the
provided input element count so using return arrays in output structures
**should** be limited to *invariant* array results.
In practice, this means that applications will typically call such query
commands multiple times:

* 
First, with the array pointer member(s) set to `NULL`, to retrieve the
number(s) of retrievable elements.

* 
Second, with the array pointer(s) pointing to an application allocated
storage for at least as many elements as indicated by the element count
member(s), to retrieve at most as many of the retrievable elements.

* 
Then the process **may** need to be repeated for all other newly introduced
return arrays in any nested output structures indirectly specified
through the previously retrieved result arrays. |

Regardless of the type of query command, any array pointer member of an
output structure **must** either be `NULL`, or point to an
application-allocated array.
Query commands **must** not return a pointer to implementation allocated
storage in any output structure.

Some query commands of the form `vkGet*` retrieve opaque binary data in
the form of a byte array and have a possible result code of
`VK_ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_SPACE_KHR`.
Such commands always have two pointer arguments as follows:

* 
A binary data size pointer pointing to a `size_t` variable,
conventionally named as `p*Size` where `*` is the capitalized
form of the name of the retrieved binary data.

* 
A pointer to a byte array where the binary data is retrieved,
conventionally named as `p*` where `*` is the capitalized form
of the name of the retrieved binary data.

If such commands are called with the binary pointer not set to `NULL`, the
binary size pointer **must** point to a variable set by the application to the
allocated size of the binary pointer.
If the input binary size is less than the total retrievable binary size, the
query will not write any data to the location pointed to the binary pointer,
and the command will return `VK_ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_SPACE_KHR` instead of
`VK_SUCCESS`.

If the return code is `VK_SUCCESS` or
`VK_ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_SPACE_KHR`, the total size of the binary data that
**can** be retrieved is returned in the variable pointed to by the binary size
pointer.

If multiple binaries are being retrieved,
`VK_ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_SPACE_KHR` will be returned if any input binary
sizes are less than their respective total retrievable binary sizes.
Unless otherwise specified, this command will determine writing data to each
binary individually based on if their input binary sizes are sufficiently
sized, following the behavior for single binary retrieval.

For all other error codes, the contents of the return structures are
**undefined**.

|  | If `VK_ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_SPACE_KHR` is returned with a command that
| --- | --- |
returns multiple binaries, the application **can** determine which binaries are
undersized by comparing the total binary size that is returned for each
binary against the allocated size that was provided to the command. |

|  | Some binary queries do not behave consistently with this pattern for
| --- | --- |
historical reasons, primarily that the `VK_ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_SPACE_KHR`
error code was not defined until after those queries were written.

A NOTE is added to each such query, describing such inconsistent behavior. |

Vulkan is intended to provide scalable performance when used on multiple
host threads.
All commands support being called concurrently from multiple threads, but
certain parameters, or components of parameters are defined to be
*externally synchronized*.
This means that the caller **must** guarantee that no more than one thread is
using such a parameter at a given time.

More precisely, Vulkan commands use simple stores to update the state of
Vulkan objects.
The implementation **may** not synchronize accesses to memory parameters or
object parameters declared as externally synchronized with other accesses.
If two commands access the same object or memory and at least one of the
commands declares the object to be externally synchronized, then the caller
**must** guarantee not only that the commands do not execute simultaneously,
but also that the two commands are separated by an appropriate memory
barrier (if needed).
Similarly, if a Vulkan command accesses a non-const memory parameter and the
application also accesses that memory, or if the application writes to that
memory and the command accesses it as a const memory parameter, the
application **must** ensure the accesses are properly synchronized with a
memory barrier if needed.

|  | Memory barriers are particularly relevant for hosts based on the ARM CPU
| --- | --- |
architecture, which is more weakly ordered than many developers are
accustomed to from x86/x64 programming.
Fortunately, most higher-level synchronization primitives (like the pthread
library) perform memory barriers as a part of mutual exclusion, so mutexing
Vulkan objects via these primitives will have the desired effect. |

Any object parameters that are not labeled as externally synchronized are
either not mutated by the command or are internally synchronized.
Additionally, certain objects related to a command’s parameters (e.g.
command pools and descriptor pools) **may** be affected by a command, and **must**
also be externally synchronized.

For [VkPipelineCache](pipelines.html#VkPipelineCache) objects created with `flags` containing
`VK_PIPELINE_CACHE_CREATE_EXTERNALLY_SYNCHRONIZED_BIT`, the above table
is extended with the `pipelineCache` parameter to
`vkCreate*Pipelines` being externally synchronized.

There are also a few instances where a command **can** take in an
application-allocated list whose contents are externally synchronized
parameters.
In these cases, the caller **must** guarantee that at most one thread is using
a given element within the list at a given time.
These parameters are listed below.

Externally Synchronized Parameter and Member Lists

* 
Each element of the `pFences` parameter in [vkResetFences](synchronization.html#vkResetFences)

* 
Each element of the `pDescriptorSets` parameter in [vkFreeDescriptorSets](descriptorsets.html#vkFreeDescriptorSets)

* 
Each element of the `pCommandBuffers` parameter in [vkFreeCommandBuffers](cmdbuffers.html#vkFreeCommandBuffers)

* 
Each element of the `pWaitSemaphores` member of [VkPresentInfoKHR](VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#VkPresentInfoKHR)

* 
Each element of the `pSwapchains` member of [VkPresentInfoKHR](VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#VkPresentInfoKHR)

In addition, there are some implicit parameters that need to be externally
synchronized.
For example, when a `commandBuffer` parameter needs to be externally
synchronized, it implies that the `commandPool` from which that command
buffer was allocated also needs to be externally synchronized.
The implicit parameters and their associated object are listed below.

Valid usage defines a set of conditions which **must** be met in order to
achieve well-defined runtime behavior in an application.
These conditions depend only on Vulkan state, and the parameters or objects
whose usage is constrained by the condition.

The core layer assumes applications are using the API correctly.
Except as documented elsewhere in the Specification, the behavior of the
core layer to an application using the API incorrectly is **undefined**, and
**may** include program termination.
However, implementations **must** ensure that incorrect usage by an application
does not affect the integrity of the operating system, the Vulkan
implementation, or other applications in the system using Vulkan.
In particular, any guarantees made by an operating system about whether
memory from one process **can** be visible to another process or not **must** not
be violated by a Vulkan implementation for **any memory allocation**.
Vulkan implementations are not **required** to make additional security or
integrity guarantees beyond those provided by the OS unless explicitly
directed by the application’s use of a particular feature or extension.

|  | For instance, if an operating system guarantees that data in all its memory
| --- | --- |
allocations are set to zero when newly allocated, the Vulkan implementation
**must** make the same guarantees for any allocations it controls (e.g.
[VkDeviceMemory](memory.html#VkDeviceMemory)).

Similarly, if an operating system guarantees that use-after-free of host
allocations will not result in values written by another process becoming
visible, the same guarantees **must** be made by the Vulkan implementation for
device memory. |

If the [`protectedMemory`](features.html#features-protectedMemory) feature is
supported, the implementation provides additional guarantees when invalid
usage occurs to prevent values in protected memory from being accessed or
inferred outside of protected operations, as described in
[Protected Memory Access Rules](memory.html#memory-protected-access-rules).

Some valid usage conditions have dependencies on runtime limits or feature
availability.
It is possible to validate these conditions against Vulkan’s minimum
supported values for these limits and features, or some subset of other
known values.

Valid usage conditions do not cover conditions where well-defined behavior
(including returning an error code) exists.

Valid usage conditions **should** apply to the command or structure where
complete information about the condition would be known during execution of
an application.
This is such that a validation layer or linter **can** be written directly
against these statements at the point they are specified.

|  | This does lead to some non-obvious places for valid usage statements.
| --- | --- |
For instance, the valid values for a structure might depend on a separate
value in the calling command.
In this case, the structure itself will not reference this valid usage as it
is impossible to determine validity from the structure that it is invalid -
instead this valid usage would be attached to the calling command.

Another example is draw state - the state setters are independent, and can
cause a legitimately invalid state configuration between draw calls; so the
valid usage statements are attached to the place where all state needs to be
valid - at the drawing command. |

Valid usage conditions are described in a block labeled “Valid Usage”
following each command or structure they apply to.

Vulkan is a layered API.
The lowest layer is the core Vulkan layer, as defined by this Specification.
The application **can** use additional layers above the core for debugging,
validation, and other purposes.

One of the core principles of Vulkan is that building and submitting command
buffers **should** be highly efficient.
Thus error checking and validation of state in the core layer is minimal,
although more rigorous validation **can** be enabled through the use of layers.

Validation of correct API usage is left to validation layers.
Applications **should** be developed with validation layers enabled, to help
catch and eliminate errors.
Once validated, released applications **should** not enable validation layers
by default.

Some valid usage conditions apply to all commands and structures in the API,
unless explicitly denoted otherwise for a specific command or structure.
These conditions are considered *implicit*, and are described in a block
labeled “Valid Usage (Implicit)” following each command or structure they
apply to.
Implicit valid usage conditions are described in detail below.

Any input parameter to a command that is an object handle **must** be a valid
object handle, unless otherwise specified.
An object handle is valid if:

* 
It has been created or allocated by a previous, successful call to the
API.
Such calls are noted in the Specification.

* 
It has not been deleted or freed by a previous call to the API.
Such calls are noted in the Specification.

* 
Any objects used by that object, either as part of creation or
execution, **must** also be valid.

The reserved values [VK_NULL_HANDLE](../appendices/boilerplate.html#VK_NULL_HANDLE) and `NULL` **can** be used in place of
valid non-dispatchable handles and dispatchable handles, respectively, when
*explicitly called out in the Specification*.
Any command that creates an object successfully **must** not return these
values.
It is valid to pass these values to `vkDestroy*` or `vkFree*`
commands, which will silently ignore these values.

Any parameter that is a pointer **must** be a *valid pointer* only if it is
explicitly called out by a Valid Usage statement.

A pointer is “valid” if it points at memory containing values of the
number and type(s) expected by the command, and all fundamental types
accessed through the pointer (e.g. as elements of an array or as members of
a structure) satisfy the alignment requirements of the host processor.

Any parameter that is a pointer to `char` **must** be a finite sequence of
values terminated by a null character, or if *explicitly called out in the
Specification*, **can** be `NULL`.

Strings specified as UTF-8 encoded **must** not contain invalid UTF-8
sequences.
See [String Representation](#fundamentals-strings) for additional
information about strings.

Any parameter of an enumerated type **must** be a valid enumerant for that
type.
Use of an enumerant is valid if the following conditions are true:

* 
The enumerant is defined as part of the enumerated type.

* 
The enumerant is not a value suffixed with `_MAX_ENUM`.

This value exists only to ensure that C `enum` types are 32 bits in
size and **must** not be used by applications.

If the enumerant is used in a function that has a [VkInstance](initialization.html#VkInstance) as
its first parameter and either:

* 
it was added by a core version that is supported
(as reported by [vkEnumerateInstanceVersion](initialization.html#vkEnumerateInstanceVersion))
and the value of [VkApplicationInfo](initialization.html#VkApplicationInfo)::`apiVersion` is greater
than or equal to the version that added it; or

* 
it was added by an [instance extension](../appendices/extensions.html#extensions) that was enabled
for the instance.

If the enumerant is used in a function that has a [VkPhysicalDevice](devsandqueues.html#VkPhysicalDevice)
object as its first parameter and either:

* 
it was added by a core version that is supported by that device (as
reported by [VkPhysicalDeviceProperties](devsandqueues.html#VkPhysicalDeviceProperties)::`apiVersion`);

* 
it was added by an [instance extension](../appendices/extensions.html#extensions) that was enabled
for the instance; or

* 
it was added by a [device extension](../appendices/extensions.html#extensions) that is supported by
that device.

If the enumerant is used in a function that has any other dispatchable
object as its first parameter and either:

* 
it was added by a core version that is supported for the device (as
reported by [VkPhysicalDeviceProperties](devsandqueues.html#VkPhysicalDeviceProperties)::`apiVersion`); or

* 
it was added by a [device extension](../appendices/extensions.html#extensions) that was enabled for
the device.

Additionally, if the [`maintenance5`](features.html#features-maintenance5) feature is
supported, any integer value representable in the range valid for the
defined type is valid when used in a function that has a
[VkPhysicalDevice](devsandqueues.html#VkPhysicalDevice) object as its first parameter.
Physical device queries will either return results indicating lack of
support, or ignore unsupported values when used as a bit flag in a
`Vk*Flags*` parameter.

Any enumerated type returned from a query command or otherwise output from
Vulkan to the application **must** not have a reserved value.
Reserved values are values not defined by any extension for that enumerated
type.

|  | In some special cases, an enumerant is only meaningful if a feature defined
| --- | --- |
by an extension is also enabled, as well as the extension itself.
The global “valid enumerant” rule described here does not address such
cases. |

|  | This language is intended to accommodate cases such as “hidden” extensions
| --- | --- |
known only to driver internals, or layers enabling extensions without
knowledge of the application, without allowing return of values not defined
by any extension. |

|  | Application developers are encouraged to be careful when using `switch`
| --- | --- |
statements with Vulkan API enums.
This is because new extensions can add new values to existing enums.
Using a `default:` statement within a `switch` may avoid future compilation
issues.

This is particularly true for enums such as [VkDriverId](devsandqueues.html#VkDriverId), which may have
values added that do not belong to a corresponding new extension. |

A collection of flags is represented by a bitmask using the type
`VkFlags`:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef uint32_t VkFlags;

Bitmasks are passed to many commands and structures to compactly represent
options, but `VkFlags` is not used directly in the API.
Instead, a `Vk*Flags` type which is an alias of `VkFlags`, and
whose name matches the corresponding `Vk*FlagBits` that are valid for
that type, is used.

Any `Vk*Flags` member or parameter used in the API as an input **must** be
a valid combination of bit flags.
A valid combination is either zero or the bitwise OR of valid bit flags.

An individual bit flag is valid for a `Vk*Flags` type if it would be a
[valid enumerant](#fundamentals-validusage-enums) when used with the
equivalent `Vk*FlagBits` type, where the bits type is obtained by taking
the flag type and replacing the trailing `Flags` with `FlagBits`.
For example, a flag value of type [VkColorComponentFlags](framebuffer.html#VkColorComponentFlags) **must** contain
only bit flags defined by [VkColorComponentFlagBits](framebuffer.html#VkColorComponentFlagBits).

Any `Vk*Flags` member or parameter returned from a query command or
otherwise output from Vulkan to the application **may** contain bit flags
**undefined** in its corresponding `Vk*FlagBits` type.
An application **cannot** rely on the state of these unspecified bits.

Only the low-order 31 bits (bit positions zero through 30) are available for
use as flag bits.

|  | This restriction is due to poorly defined behavior by C compilers given a C
| --- | --- |
enumerant value of `0x80000000`.
In some cases adding this enumerant value may increase the size of the
underlying `Vk*FlagBits` type, breaking the ABI. |

A collection of 64-bit flags is represented by a bitmask using the type
`VkFlags64`:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3, VK_KHR_synchronization2
typedef uint64_t VkFlags64;

When the 31 bits available in `VkFlags` are insufficient, the
`VkFlags64` type can be passed to commands and structures to
represent up to 64 options.
`VkFlags64` is not used directly in the API.
Instead, a `Vk*Flags2` type which is an alias of `VkFlags64`, and
whose name matches the corresponding `Vk*FlagBits2` that are valid for
that type, is used.

Any `Vk*Flags2` member or parameter used in the API as an input **must** be
a valid combination of bit flags.
A valid combination is either zero or the bitwise OR of valid bit flags.

An individual bit flag is valid for a `Vk*Flags2` type if it would be a
[valid enumerant](#fundamentals-validusage-enums) when used with the
equivalent `Vk*FlagBits2` type, where the bits type is obtained by
taking the flag type and replacing the trailing `Flags2` with
`FlagBits2`.
For example, a flag value of type [VkAccessFlags2KHR](synchronization.html#VkAccessFlags2KHR) **must** contain only
bit flags defined by [VkAccessFlagBits2KHR](synchronization.html#VkAccessFlagBits2KHR).

Any `Vk*Flags2` member or parameter returned from a query command or
otherwise output from Vulkan to the application **may** contain bit flags
**undefined** in its corresponding `Vk*FlagBits2` type.
An application **cannot** rely on the state of these unspecified bits.

|  | Both the `Vk*FlagBits2` type, and the individual bits defined for that
| --- | --- |
type, are defined as `uint64_t` integers in the C API.
This is in contrast to the 32-bit types, where the `Vk*FlagBits` type is
defined as a C `enum` and the individual bits as enumerants belonging to
that `enum`.
As a result, there is less compile time type checking possible for the
64-bit types.
This is unavoidable since there is no sufficiently portable way to define a
64-bit `enum` type in C99. |

Any parameter that is a structure containing a `sType` member **must** have
a value of `sType` which is a valid [VkStructureType](#VkStructureType) value matching
the type of the structure.

Any parameter that is a structure containing a `void*` `pNext` member
**must** have a value of `pNext` that is either `NULL`, or is a pointer to
a valid *extending structure*, containing `sType` and `pNext`
members as described in the [Vulkan Documentation and Extensions](introduction.html#vulkan-styleguide) document in the section “Extending Structures”.
The set of structures connected by `pNext` pointers is referred to as a
*`pNext` chain*.

Each structure included in the `pNext` chain **must** be defined at runtime
by either:

* 
a core version which is supported

* 
an extension which is enabled

* 
a supported device extension in the case of physical-device-level
functionality added by the device extension

Each type of extending structure **must** not appear more than once in a
`pNext` chain, including any
[aliases](extensions.html#extendingvulkan-compatibility-aliases).
This general rule may be explicitly overridden for specific structures.

Any component of the implementation (the loader, any enabled layers, and
drivers) **must** skip over, without processing (other than reading the
`sType` and `pNext` members) any extending structures in the chain
not defined by core versions or extensions supported by that component.

As a convenience to implementations and layers needing to iterate through a
structure pointer chain, the Vulkan API provides two *base structures*.
These structures allow for some type safety, and can be used by Vulkan API
functions that operate on generic inputs and outputs.

The `VkBaseInStructure` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkBaseInStructure {
    VkStructureType                    sType;
    const struct VkBaseInStructure*    pNext;
} VkBaseInStructure;

* 
`sType` is the structure type of the structure being iterated
through.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
chain.

`VkBaseInStructure` can be used to facilitate iterating through a
read-only structure pointer chain.

The `VkBaseOutStructure` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkBaseOutStructure {
    VkStructureType               sType;
    struct VkBaseOutStructure*    pNext;
} VkBaseOutStructure;

* 
`sType` is the structure type of the structure being iterated
through.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
chain.

`VkBaseOutStructure` can be used to facilitate iterating through a
structure pointer chain that returns data back to the application.

The above conditions also apply recursively to members of structures
provided as input to a command, either as a direct argument to the command,
or themselves a member of another structure.

Specifics on valid usage of each command are covered in their individual
sections.

Instance-level functionality or behavior added by an [instance extension](../appendices/extensions.html#extensions) to the API **must** not be used unless that extension is supported
by the instance as determined by
[vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties](extensions.html#vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties), and that extension is enabled
in [VkInstanceCreateInfo](initialization.html#VkInstanceCreateInfo).

Physical-device-level functionality or behavior added by an [instance extension](../appendices/extensions.html#extensions) to the API **must** not be used unless that extension is
supported by the instance as determined by
[vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties](extensions.html#vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties), and that extension is enabled
in [VkInstanceCreateInfo](initialization.html#VkInstanceCreateInfo).

Physical-device-level functionality or behavior added by a [device extension](../appendices/extensions.html#extensions) to the API **must** not be used unless the conditions
described in [Extending Physical Device From Device Extensions](initialization.html#initialization-phys-dev-extensions) are met.

Device-level functionality added by a [device extension](../appendices/extensions.html#extensions) that
is dispatched from a [VkDevice](devsandqueues.html#VkDevice), or from a child object of a
[VkDevice](devsandqueues.html#VkDevice) **must** not be used unless that extension is supported by the
device as determined by [vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties](extensions.html#vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties), and that
extension is enabled in [VkDeviceCreateInfo](devsandqueues.html#VkDeviceCreateInfo).

Instance-level functionality or behavior added by a [new core version](../appendices/versions.html#versions) of the API **must** not be used unless it is supported by the
instance as determined by [vkEnumerateInstanceVersion](initialization.html#vkEnumerateInstanceVersion) and the specified
version of [VkApplicationInfo](initialization.html#VkApplicationInfo)::`apiVersion`.

Physical-device-level functionality or behavior added by a [new core version](../appendices/versions.html#versions) of the API **must** not be used unless it is supported by the
physical device as determined by
[VkPhysicalDeviceProperties](devsandqueues.html#VkPhysicalDeviceProperties)::`apiVersion` and the specified version
of [VkApplicationInfo](initialization.html#VkApplicationInfo)::`apiVersion`.

Device-level functionality or behavior added by a [new core version](../appendices/versions.html#versions) of the API **must** not be used unless it is supported by the device
as determined by [VkPhysicalDeviceProperties](devsandqueues.html#VkPhysicalDeviceProperties)::`apiVersion` and the
specified version of [VkApplicationInfo](initialization.html#VkApplicationInfo)::`apiVersion`.

While the core Vulkan API is not designed to capture incorrect usage, some
circumstances still require return codes.
Commands in Vulkan return their status via return codes that are in one of
two categories:

* 
Successful completion codes are returned when a command needs to
communicate success or status information.
All successful completion codes are non-negative values.

* 
Runtime error codes are returned when a command needs to communicate a
failure that could only be detected at runtime.
All runtime error codes are negative values.

All return codes in Vulkan are reported via [VkResult](#VkResult) return values.
The possible codes are:

`VK_ERROR_FRAGMENTED_POOL` A pool allocation has failed due to
fragmentation of the pool’s memory.
This **must** only be returned if no attempt to allocate host or device

enough space to return all the required data.

* 
`VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN` An unknown error has occurred; either the

occurred.

If a command returns a runtime error, unless otherwise specified any output
parameters will have **undefined** contents, except that if the output
parameter is a structure with `sType` and `pNext` fields, those
fields will be unmodified.
Any structures chained from `pNext` will also have **undefined** contents,
except that `sType` and `pNext` will be unmodified.

`VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_*_MEMORY` errors do not modify any currently existing
Vulkan objects.
Objects that have already been successfully created **can** still be used by
the application.

|  | As a general rule, `Free`, `Release`, and `Reset` commands do
| --- | --- |
not return `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY`, while any other command with a
return code **may** return it.
Any exceptions from this rule are described for those commands. |

`VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN` will be returned by an implementation when an
unexpected error occurs that cannot be attributed to valid behavior of the
application and implementation.
Under these conditions, it **may** be returned from any command returning a
[VkResult](#VkResult).

|  | `VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN` is not expected to ever be returned if the
| --- | --- |
application behavior is valid, and if the implementation is bug-free.
If `VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN` is received, the application should be checked
against the latest validation layers to verify correct behavior as much as
possible.
If no issues are identified it could be an implementation issue, and the
implementor should be contacted for support. |

Any command returning a [VkResult](#VkResult) **may** return
`VK_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILED_EXT`
if a violation of valid usage is detected, even though commands do not
explicitly list this as a possible return code.

Performance-critical commands generally do not have return codes.
If a runtime error occurs in such commands, the implementation will defer
reporting the error until a specified point.
For commands that record into command buffers (`vkCmd*`) runtime errors
are reported by `vkEndCommandBuffer`.

Implementations normally perform computations in floating-point, and **must**
meet the range and precision requirements defined under “Floating-Point
Computation” below.

These requirements only apply to computations performed in Vulkan operations
outside of shader execution, such as texture image specification and
sampling, and per-fragment operations.
Range and precision requirements during shader execution differ and are
specified by the [Precision and Operation of SPIR-V Instructions](../appendices/spirvenv.html#spirvenv-precision-operation) section.

In some cases, the representation and/or precision of operations is
implicitly limited by the specified format of vertex or texel data consumed
by Vulkan.
Specific floating-point formats are described later in this section.

Most floating-point computation is performed in SPIR-V shader modules.
The properties of computation within shaders are constrained as defined by
the [Precision and Operation of SPIR-V Instructions](../appendices/spirvenv.html#spirvenv-precision-operation) section.

Some floating-point computation is performed outside of shaders, such as
viewport and depth range calculations.
For these computations, we do not specify how floating-point numbers are to
be represented, or the details of how operations on them are performed, but
only place minimal requirements on representation and precision as described
in the remainder of this section.

We require simply that numbers’ floating-point parts contain enough bits
and that their exponent fields are large enough so that individual results
of floating-point operations are accurate to about 1 part in 105.
The maximum representable magnitude for all floating-point values **must** be
at least 232.

x × 0 = 0 × x = 0 for any non-infinite and
non-NaN x.

1 × x = x × 1 = x.

x +  0 = 0 +  x = x.

00 = 1.

Occasionally, further requirements will be specified.
Most single-precision floating-point formats meet these requirements.

The special values Inf and -Inf encode values with magnitudes
too large to be represented; the special value NaN encodes “Not A
Number” values resulting from **undefined** arithmetic operations such as
0 / 0.
Implementations **may** support Inf and NaN in their floating-point
computations.
Any computation which does not support either Inf or NaN, for
which that value is an input or output will yield an **undefined** value.

When a value is converted to a defined floating-point representation, finite
values falling between two representable finite values are rounded to one or
the other.
The rounding mode is not defined.
Finite values whose magnitude is larger than that of any representable
finite value may be rounded either to the closest representable finite value
or to the appropriately signed infinity.
For unsigned destination formats any negative values are converted to zero.
Positive infinity is converted to positive infinity; negative infinity is
converted to negative infinity in signed formats and to zero in unsigned
formats; and any NaN is converted to a NaN.

16-bit floating-point numbers are defined in the “16-bit floating-point
numbers” section of the [Khronos Data Format Specification](introduction.html#data-format).

Unsigned 11-bit floating-point numbers are defined in the “Unsigned 11-bit
floating-point numbers” section of the [Khronos Data Format Specification](introduction.html#data-format).

Unsigned 10-bit floating-point numbers are defined in the “Unsigned 10-bit
floating-point numbers” section of the [Khronos Data Format Specification](introduction.html#data-format).

Any representable floating-point value in the appropriate format is legal as
input to a Vulkan command that requires floating-point data.
The result of providing a value that is not a floating-point number to such
a command is unspecified, but **must** not lead to Vulkan interruption or
termination.
For example, providing a negative zero (where applicable) or a denormalized
number to a Vulkan command **must** yield deterministic results, while
providing a NaN or Inf yields unspecified results.

Some calculations require division.
In such cases (including implied divisions performed by vector
normalization), division by zero produces an unspecified result but **must**
not lead to Vulkan interruption or termination.

When generic vertex attributes and pixel color or depth *components* are
represented as integers, they are often (but not always) considered to be
*normalized*.
Normalized integer values are treated specially when being converted to and
from floating-point values, and are usually referred to as *normalized
fixed-point*.

In the remainder of this section, b denotes the bit width of the
fixed-point integer representation.
When the integer is one of the types defined by the API, b is the bit
width of that type.
When the integer comes from an [image](resources.html#resources-images) containing color
or depth component texels, b is the number of bits allocated to that
component in its [specified image format](formats.html#formats).

The signed and unsigned fixed-point representations are assumed to be
b-bit binary two’s-complement integers and binary unsigned integers,
respectively.

Unsigned normalized fixed-point integers represent numbers in the range
[0,1].
The conversion from an unsigned normalized fixed-point value c to the
corresponding floating-point value f is defined as

  

  

Signed normalized fixed-point integers represent numbers in the range
[-1,1].
The conversion from a signed normalized fixed-point value c to the
corresponding floating-point value f is performed using

  

  

Only the range [-2b-1 +  1, 2b-1 - 1] is used to represent
signed fixed-point values in the range [-1,1].
For example, if b = 8, then the integer value -127 corresponds
to -1.0 and the value 127 corresponds to 1.0.
This equation is used everywhere that signed normalized fixed-point values
are converted to floating-point.

Note that while zero is exactly expressible in this representation, one
value (-128 in the example) is outside the representable range, and
implementations **must** clamp it to -1.0.
Where the value is subject to further processing by the implementation, e.g.
during texture filtering, values less than -1.0 **may** be used but the
result **must** be clamped before the value is returned to shaders.

The conversion from a floating-point value f to the corresponding
unsigned normalized fixed-point value c is defined by first clamping
f to the range [0,1], then computing

c = convertFloatToUint(f × (2b - 1), b)

where convertFloatToUint(r,b) returns one of the two unsigned binary
integer values with exactly b bits which are closest to the
floating-point value r.
Implementations **should** round to nearest.
If r is equal to an integer, then that integer value **must** be
returned.
In particular, if f is equal to 0.0 or 1.0, then c **must** be
assigned 0 or 2b - 1, respectively.

The conversion from a floating-point value f to the corresponding
signed normalized fixed-point value c is performed by clamping f
to the range [-1,1], then computing

c = convertFloatToInt(f × (2b-1 - 1), b)

where convertFloatToInt(r,b) returns one of the two signed
two’s-complement binary integer values with exactly b bits which are
closest to the floating-point value r.
Implementations **should** round to nearest.
If r is equal to an integer, then that integer value **must** be
returned.
In particular, if f is equal to -1.0, 0.0, or 1.0, then c **must**
be assigned -(2b-1 - 1), 0, or 2b-1 - 1, respectively.

This equation is used everywhere that floating-point values are converted to
signed normalized fixed-point.

Strings passed into and returned from Vulkan API commands are usually
defined to be null-terminated and UTF-8 encoded.

|  | Exceptions to this rule exist only when strings are defined or used by
| --- | --- |
operating system APIs where that OS has a different convention.
For example, [VkExportMemoryWin32HandleInfoKHR](memory.html#VkExportMemoryWin32HandleInfoKHR)::`name` is a
null-terminated UTF-16 encoded string used in conjunction with Windows
handles. |

When a UTF-8 string is **returned from** a Vulkan API query, it is returned in
a fixed-length buffer of C `char`.
For example, a string returned in
[VkPhysicalDeviceProperties](devsandqueues.html#VkPhysicalDeviceProperties)::`deviceName` has maximum length
`VK_MAX_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_NAME_SIZE`, and a string returned in
[VkExtensionProperties](extensions.html#VkExtensionProperties)::`extensionName` has maximum length
`VK_MAX_EXTENSION_NAME_SIZE`.
The string, **including** its null terminator, will always fit completely
within this buffer.
If the string is shorter than the buffer size, the contents of `char` in
the buffer following the null terminator are **undefined**.

When a UTF-8 string is **passed into** a Vulkan API, such as
[VkDeviceCreateInfo](devsandqueues.html#VkDeviceCreateInfo)::`ppEnabledExtensionNames`, there is no
explicit limit on the length of that string.
However, the string **must** contain a valid UTF-8 encoded string and **must** be
null-terminated.

Some types of Vulkan objects are used in many different structures and
command parameters, and are described here.
These types include *offsets*, *extents*, and *rectangles*.

Offsets are used to describe a pixel location within an image or
framebuffer, as an (x,y) location for two-dimensional images, or an (x,y,z)
location for three-dimensional images.

A two-dimensional offset is defined by the structure:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkOffset2D {
    int32_t    x;
    int32_t    y;
} VkOffset2D;

* 
`x` is the x offset.

* 
`y` is the y offset.

A three-dimensional offset is defined by the structure:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkOffset3D {
    int32_t    x;
    int32_t    y;
    int32_t    z;
} VkOffset3D;

* 
`x` is the x offset.

* 
`y` is the y offset.

* 
`z` is the z offset.

Extents are used to describe the size of a rectangular region of pixels
within an image or framebuffer, as (width,height) for two-dimensional
images, or as (width,height,depth) for three-dimensional images.

A two-dimensional extent is defined by the structure:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkExtent2D {
    uint32_t    width;
    uint32_t    height;
} VkExtent2D;

* 
`width` is the width of the extent.

* 
`height` is the height of the extent.

A three-dimensional extent is defined by the structure:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkExtent3D {
    uint32_t    width;
    uint32_t    height;
    uint32_t    depth;
} VkExtent3D;

* 
`width` is the width of the extent.

* 
`height` is the height of the extent.

* 
`depth` is the depth of the extent.

Rectangles are used to describe a specified rectangular region of pixels
within an image or framebuffer.
Rectangles include both an offset and an extent of the same dimensionality,
as described above.
Two-dimensional rectangles are defined by the structure

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkRect2D {
    VkOffset2D    offset;
    VkExtent2D    extent;
} VkRect2D;

* 
`offset` is a [VkOffset2D](#VkOffset2D) specifying the rectangle offset.

* 
`extent` is a [VkExtent2D](#VkExtent2D) specifying the rectangle extent.

Each value corresponds to a particular structure with a `sType` member
with a matching name.
As a general rule, the name of each [VkStructureType](#VkStructureType) value is obtained
by taking the name of the structure, stripping the leading `Vk`,
prefixing each capital letter with `_`, converting the entire resulting
string to upper case, and prefixing it with `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_`.
For example, structures of type [VkImageCreateInfo](resources.html#VkImageCreateInfo) correspond to a
[VkStructureType](#VkStructureType) value of `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_CREATE_INFO`,
and thus a structure of this type **must** have its `sType` member set to
this value before it is passed to the API.

The values `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_LOADER_INSTANCE_CREATE_INFO` and
`VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_LOADER_DEVICE_CREATE_INFO` are reserved for internal
use by the loader, and do not have corresponding Vulkan structures in this
Specification.

A small number of APIs did not follow the [naming conventions](introduction.html#vulkan-styleguide) when initially defined.
For consistency, when we discover an API name that violates the naming
conventions, we rename it in the Specification, XML, and header files.
For backwards compatibility, the original (incorrect) name is retained as a
“typo alias”.
The alias is deprecated and should not be used, but will be retained
indefinitely.

|  | `VK_STENCIL_FRONT_AND_BACK` is an example of a *typo alias*.
| --- | --- |
It was initially defined as part of [VkStencilFaceFlagBits](fragops.html#VkStencilFaceFlagBits).
Once the naming inconsistency was noticed, it was renamed to
`VK_STENCIL_FACE_FRONT_AND_BACK`, and the old name was aliased to the
correct name. |
