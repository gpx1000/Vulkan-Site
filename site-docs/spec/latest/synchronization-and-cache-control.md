## Content

Synchronization of access to resources is primarily the responsibility of
the application in Vulkan.
The order of execution of commands with respect to the host and other
commands on the device has few implicit guarantees, and needs to be
explicitly specified.
Memory caches and other optimizations are also explicitly managed, requiring
that the flow of data through the system is largely under application
control.

Whilst some implicit guarantees exist between commands, five explicit
synchronization mechanisms are exposed by Vulkan:

[Fences](#synchronization-fences)

Fences **can** be used to communicate to the host that execution of some
task on the device has completed, controlling resource access between
host and device.

[Semaphores](#synchronization-semaphores)

Semaphores **can** be used to control resource access across multiple
queues.

[Events](#synchronization-events)

Events provide a fine-grained synchronization primitive which **can** be
signaled either within a command buffer or by the host, and **can** be
waited upon within a command buffer or queried on the host.
Events **can** be used to control resource access within a single queue.

[Pipeline Barriers](#synchronization-pipeline-barriers)

Pipeline barriers also provide synchronization control within a command
buffer, but at a single point, rather than with separate signal and wait
operations.
Pipeline barriers **can** be used to control resource access within a
single queue.

[Render Pass Objects](renderpass.html#renderpass-objects)

Render pass objects provide a synchronization framework for rendering
tasks, built upon the concepts in this chapter.
Many cases that would otherwise need an application to use other
synchronization primitives **can** be expressed more efficiently as part of
a render pass.
Render pass objects **can** be used to control resource access within a
single queue.

An *operation* is an arbitrary amount of work to be executed on the host, a
device, or an external entity such as a presentation engine.
Synchronization commands introduce explicit *execution dependencies*, and
*memory dependencies* between two sets of operations defined by the
command’s two *synchronization scopes*.

The synchronization scopes define which other operations a synchronization
command is able to create execution dependencies with.
Any type of operation that is not in a synchronization command’s
synchronization scopes will not be included in the resulting dependency.
For example, for many synchronization commands, the synchronization scopes
**can** be limited to just operations executing in specific
[pipeline stages](#synchronization-pipeline-stages), which allows other
pipeline stages to be excluded from a dependency.
Other scoping options are possible, depending on the particular command.

An *execution dependency* is a guarantee that for two sets of operations,
the first set **must** *happen-before* the second set.
If an operation happens-before another operation, then the first operation
**must** complete before the second operation is initiated.
More precisely:

* 
Let **Ops1** and **Ops2** be separate sets of operations.

* 
Let **Sync** be a synchronization command.

* 
Let **Scope1st** and **Scope2nd** be the synchronization scopes of
**Sync**.

* 
Let **ScopedOps1** be the intersection of sets **Ops1** and
**Scope1st**.

* 
Let **ScopedOps2** be the intersection of sets **Ops2** and
**Scope2nd**.

* 
Submitting **Ops1**, **Sync** and **Ops2** for execution, in that order,
will result in execution dependency **ExeDep** between **ScopedOps1** and
**ScopedOps2**.

* 
Execution dependency **ExeDep** guarantees that **ScopedOps1**
happen-before **ScopedOps2**.

An *execution dependency chain* is a sequence of execution dependencies that
form a happens-before relation between the first dependency’s **ScopedOps1**
and the final dependency’s **ScopedOps2**.
For each consecutive pair of execution dependencies, a chain exists if the
intersection of **Scope2nd** in the first dependency and **Scope1st** in the
second dependency is not an empty set.
The formation of a single execution dependency from an execution dependency
chain can be described by substituting the following in the description of
execution dependencies:

* 
Let **Sync** be a set of synchronization commands that generate an
execution dependency chain.

* 
Let **Scope1st** be the first synchronization scope of the first command
in **Sync**.

* 
Let **Scope2nd** be the second synchronization scope of the last command
in **Sync**.

Execution dependencies alone are not sufficient to guarantee that values
resulting from writes in one set of operations **can** be read from another set
of operations.

Three additional types of operations are used to control memory access.
*Availability operations* cause the values generated by specified memory
write accesses to become *available* to a memory domain for future access.
Any available value remains available until a subsequent write to the same
memory location occurs (whether it is made available or not) or the memory
is freed.
*Memory domain operations* cause writes that are available to a source
memory domain to become available to a destination memory domain (an example
of this is making writes available to the host domain available to the
device domain).
*Visibility operations* cause values available to a memory domain to become
*visible* to specified memory accesses.

Availability, visibility, memory domains, and memory domain operations are
formally defined in the [Availability and Visibility](../appendices/memorymodel.html#memory-model-availability-visibility) section of the [Memory Model](../appendices/memorymodel.html#memory-model) chapter.
Which API operations perform each of these operations is defined in
[Availability, Visibility, and Domain Operations](../appendices/memorymodel.html#memory-model-vulkan-availability-visibility).

A *memory dependency* is an execution dependency which includes availability
and visibility operations such that:

* 
The first set of operations happens-before the availability operation.

* 
The availability operation happens-before the visibility operation.

* 
The visibility operation happens-before the second set of operations.

Once written values are made visible to a particular type of memory access,
they **can** be read or written by that type of memory access.
Most synchronization commands in Vulkan define a memory dependency.

The specific memory accesses that are made available and visible are defined
by the *access scopes* of a memory dependency.
Any type of access that is in a memory dependency’s first access scope and
occurs in **ScopedOps1** is made available.
Any type of access that is in a memory dependency’s second access scope and
occurs in **ScopedOps2** has any available writes made visible to it.
Any type of operation that is not in a synchronization command’s access
scopes will not be included in the resulting dependency.

A memory dependency enforces availability and visibility of memory accesses
and execution order between two sets of operations.
Adding to the description of [execution dependency chains](#synchronization-dependencies-chains):

* 
Let **MemOps1** be the set of memory accesses performed by
**ScopedOps1**.

* 
Let **MemOps2** be the set of memory accesses performed by
**ScopedOps2**.

* 
Let **AccessScope1st** be the first access scope of the first command in
the **Sync** chain.

* 
Let **AccessScope2nd** be the second access scope of the last command in
the **Sync** chain.

* 
Let **ScopedMemOps1** be the intersection of sets **MemOps1** and
**AccessScope1st**.

* 
Let **ScopedMemOps2** be the intersection of sets **MemOps2** and
**AccessScope2nd**.

* 
Submitting **Ops1**, **Sync**, and **Ops2** for execution, in that order,
will result in a memory dependency **MemDep** between **ScopedOps1** and
**ScopedOps2**.

* 
Memory dependency **MemDep** guarantees that:

Memory writes in **ScopedMemOps1** are made available.

* 
Available memory writes, including those from **ScopedMemOps1**, are
made visible to **ScopedMemOps2**.

|  | Execution and memory dependencies are used to solve data hazards, i.e. to
| --- | --- |
ensure that read and write operations occur in a well-defined order.
Write-after-read hazards can be solved with just an execution dependency,
but read-after-write and write-after-write hazards need appropriate memory
dependencies to be included between them.
If an application does not include dependencies to solve these hazards, the
results and execution orders of memory accesses are **undefined**. |

Image subresources **can** be transitioned from one [layout](resources.html#resources-image-layouts) to another as part of a [memory dependency](#synchronization-dependencies-memory) (e.g. by using an
[image memory barrier](#synchronization-image-memory-barriers)).
When a layout transition is specified in a memory dependency, it
happens-after the availability operations in the memory dependency, and
happens-before the visibility operations.
Image layout transitions **may** perform read and write accesses on all memory
bound to the image subresource range, so applications **must** ensure that all
memory writes have been made
[available](#synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible) before a
layout transition is executed.
Available memory is automatically made visible to a layout transition, and
writes performed by a layout transition are automatically made available.

Layout transitions always apply to a particular image subresource range, and
specify both an old layout and new layout.
The old layout **must** either be `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED`, or match the
current layout of the image subresource range.
If the old layout matches the current layout of the image subresource range,
the transition preserves the contents of that range.
If the old layout is `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED`, the contents of that
range **may** be discarded.

|  | Image layout transitions with `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED` allow the
| --- | --- |
implementation to discard the image subresource range, which can provide
performance or power benefits.
Tile-based architectures may be able to avoid flushing tile data to memory,
and immediate style renderers may be able to achieve fast metadata clears to
reinitialize frame buffer compression state, or similar.

If the contents of an attachment are not needed after a render pass
completes, then applications **should** use
`VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE`. |

As image layout transitions **may** perform read and write accesses on the
memory bound to the image, if the image subresource affected by the layout
transition is bound to peer memory for any device in the current device mask
then the memory heap the bound memory comes from **must** support the
`VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_SRC_BIT` and
`VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_DST_BIT` capabilities as returned by
[vkGetDeviceGroupPeerMemoryFeatures](memory.html#vkGetDeviceGroupPeerMemoryFeatures).

|  | Applications **must** ensure that layout transitions happen-after all
| --- | --- |
operations accessing the image with the old layout, and happen-before any
operations that will access the image with the new layout.
Layout transitions are potentially read/write operations, so not defining
appropriate memory dependencies to guarantee this will result in a data
race. |

Image layout transitions interact with [memory aliasing](resources.html#resources-memory-aliasing).

Layout transitions that are performed via image memory barriers execute in
their entirety in [submission order](#synchronization-submission-order),
relative to other image layout transitions submitted to the same queue,
including those performed by [render passes](renderpass.html#renderpass).
In effect there is an implicit execution dependency from each such layout
transition to all layout transitions previously submitted to the same queue.

The image layout of each image subresource of a depth/stencil image created
with `VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS_COMPATIBLE_DEPTH_BIT_EXT` is
dependent on the last sample locations used to render to the image
subresource as a depth/stencil attachment, thus when the `image` member
of an [image memory barrier](#synchronization-image-memory-barriers) is an
image created with this flag the application **can** chain a
[VkSampleLocationsInfoEXT](primsrast.html#VkSampleLocationsInfoEXT) structure to the `pNext` chain of
[VkImageMemoryBarrier2](#VkImageMemoryBarrier2) or
[VkImageMemoryBarrier](#VkImageMemoryBarrier) to specify the sample locations to use during any
image layout transition.

If the `VkSampleLocationsInfoEXT` structure does not match the sample
location state last used to render to the image subresource range specified
by `subresourceRange`, or if no `VkSampleLocationsInfoEXT` structure
is present, then the contents of the given image subresource range becomes
**undefined** as if `oldLayout` would equal
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED`.

The work performed by an [action command](fundamentals.html#fundamentals-queueoperation-command-types) consists of multiple operations, which are performed as a sequence
of logically independent steps known as *pipeline stages*.
The exact pipeline stages executed depend on the particular command that is
used, and current command buffer state when the command was recorded.

|  | Operations performed by synchronization commands (e.g.
| --- | --- |
[availability and visibility operations](#synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible)) are not executed by a defined pipeline stage.
However other commands can still synchronize with them by using the
[synchronization scopes](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) to create a
[dependency chain](#synchronization-dependencies-chains). |

Execution of operations across pipeline stages **must** adhere to
[implicit ordering guarantees](#synchronization-implicit), particularly
including [pipeline stage order](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-order).
Otherwise, execution across pipeline stages **may** overlap or execute out of
order with regards to other stages, unless otherwise enforced by an
execution dependency.

Several of the synchronization commands include pipeline stage parameters,
restricting the [synchronization scopes](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) for that command to just those stages.
This allows fine grained control over the exact execution dependencies and
accesses performed by action commands.
Implementations **should** use these pipeline stages to avoid unnecessary
stalls or cache flushing.

Bits which **can** be set in a [VkPipelineStageFlags2](#VkPipelineStageFlags2) mask, specifying
stages of execution, are:

Pipeline stages that execute as a result of a command logically complete
execution in a specific order, such that completion of a logically later
pipeline stage **must** not happen-before completion of a logically earlier
stage.
This means that including any stage in the source stage mask for a
particular synchronization command also implies that any logically earlier
stages are included in **Scope1st** for that command.

Similarly, initiation of a logically earlier pipeline stage **must** not
happen-after initiation of a logically later pipeline stage.
Including any given stage in the destination stage mask for a particular
synchronization command also implies that any logically later stages are
included in **Scope2nd** for that command.

|  | Implementations **may** not support synchronization at every pipeline stage for
| --- | --- |
every synchronization operation.
If a pipeline stage that an implementation does not support synchronization
for appears in a source stage mask, it **may** substitute any logically later
stage in its place for the first synchronization scope.
If a pipeline stage that an implementation does not support synchronization
for appears in a destination stage mask, it **may** substitute any logically
earlier stage in its place for the second synchronization scope.

For example, if an implementation is unable to signal an event immediately
after vertex shader execution is complete, it **may** instead signal the event
after color attachment output has completed.

If an implementation makes such a substitution, it **must** not affect the
semantics of execution or memory dependencies or image and buffer memory
barriers. |

Memory in Vulkan **can** be accessed from within shader invocations and via
some fixed-function stages of the pipeline.
The *access type* is a function of the [descriptor type](descriptorsets.html#descriptorsets)
used, or how a fixed-function stage accesses memory.

Some synchronization commands take sets of access types as parameters to
define the [access scopes](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) of
a memory dependency.
If a synchronization command includes a *source access mask*, its first
[access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) only includes
accesses via the access types specified in that mask.
Similarly, if a synchronization command includes a *destination access
mask*, its second [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) only includes accesses via the access types specified in that mask.

Bits which **can** be set in the `srcAccessMask` and `dstAccessMask`
members of [VkMemoryBarrier2KHR](#VkMemoryBarrier2KHR), [VkImageMemoryBarrier2KHR](#VkImageMemoryBarrier2KHR), and
[VkBufferMemoryBarrier2KHR](#VkBufferMemoryBarrier2KHR), specifying access behavior, are:

|  | In situations where an application wishes to select all access types for a
| --- | --- |
given set of pipeline stages, `VK_ACCESS_2_MEMORY_READ_BIT` or
`VK_ACCESS_2_MEMORY_WRITE_BIT` can be used.
This is particularly useful when specifying stages that only have a single
access type. |

|  | The `VkAccessFlags2` bitmask goes beyond the 31 individual bit flags
| --- | --- |
allowable within a C99 enum, which is how [VkAccessFlagBits](#VkAccessFlagBits) is defined.
The first 31 values are common to both, and are interchangeable. |

`VkAccessFlags2` is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero or more
[VkAccessFlagBits2](#VkAccessFlagBits2):

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
typedef VkFlags64 VkAccessFlags2;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_synchronization2
typedef VkAccessFlags2 VkAccessFlags2KHR;

An application **can** link a [VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR](#VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR) structure in
the `pNext` chain of [VkMemoryBarrier2](#VkMemoryBarrier2),
[VkBufferMemoryBarrier2](#VkBufferMemoryBarrier2), or [VkImageMemoryBarrier2](#VkImageMemoryBarrier2) to provide
additional access flags beyond those available in [VkAccessFlagBits2](#VkAccessFlagBits2).

The `VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance8
typedef struct VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR {
    VkStructureType      sType;
    const void*          pNext;
    VkAccessFlags3KHR    srcAccessMask3;
    VkAccessFlags3KHR    dstAccessMask3;
} VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`srcAccessMask3` is a [VkAccessFlags3KHR](#VkAccessFlags3KHR) mask of access flags
to be included in the [    first access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes).

* 
`dstAccessMask3` is a [VkAccessFlags3KHR](#VkAccessFlags3KHR) mask of access flags
to be included in the [    second access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR-sType-sType) VUID-VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_MEMORY_BARRIER_ACCESS_FLAGS_3_KHR`

* 
[](#VUID-VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR-srcAccessMask3-parameter) VUID-VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR-srcAccessMask3-parameter

 `srcAccessMask3` **must** be a valid combination of [VkAccessFlagBits3KHR](#VkAccessFlagBits3KHR) values

* 
[](#VUID-VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR-dstAccessMask3-parameter) VUID-VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR-dstAccessMask3-parameter

 `dstAccessMask3` **must** be a valid combination of [VkAccessFlagBits3KHR](#VkAccessFlagBits3KHR) values

Bits which **can** be set in the `srcAccessMask3` and `dstAccessMask3`
members of [VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR](#VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR), specifying access behavior,
are:

// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance8
// Flag bits for VkAccessFlagBits3KHR
typedef VkFlags64 VkAccessFlagBits3KHR;
static const VkAccessFlagBits3KHR VK_ACCESS_3_NONE_KHR = 0ULL;

* 
`VK_ACCESS_3_NONE_KHR` specifies no additional accesses.

`VkAccessFlags3KHR` is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero or more
[VkAccessFlagBits3KHR](#VkAccessFlagBits3KHR):

// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance8
typedef VkFlags64 VkAccessFlags3KHR;

When a [VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR](#VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR) structure is linked in the
`pNext` field of [VkMemoryBarrier2](#VkMemoryBarrier2), [VkBufferMemoryBarrier2](#VkBufferMemoryBarrier2),
or [VkImageMemoryBarrier2](#VkImageMemoryBarrier2), the flags specified in the
`srcAccessMask3` and `dstAccessMask3` fields are considered in
addition to the flags in the `srcAccessMask` and `dstAccessMask`
fields, respectively, to allow up to 128 total access types to be specified
for the first or second [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes).

|  | When [VkAccessFlagBits3KHR](#VkAccessFlagBits3KHR) and [VkAccessFlagBits2](#VkAccessFlagBits2) are used
| --- | --- |
together, the two sets of 64 flags bits are combined together into 128 flag
bits (effectively OR’ing them together).
This is different from [VkAccessFlagBits2](#VkAccessFlagBits2) and [VkAccessFlagBits](#VkAccessFlagBits),
where the 64 bit [VkAccessFlagBits2](#VkAccessFlagBits2) extends and *replaces* the 32 bit
[VkAccessFlagBits](#VkAccessFlagBits). |

members of [VkSubpassDependency](renderpass.html#VkSubpassDependency),

`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COMMAND_PREPROCESS_BIT_EXT` pipeline stage.

* 
`VK_ACCESS_COMMAND_PREPROCESS_WRITE_BIT_EXT` specifies writes to the
target command buffer preprocess outputs in
[vkCmdPreprocessGeneratedCommandsEXT](device_generated_commands/generatedcommands.html#vkCmdPreprocessGeneratedCommandsEXT).
Such access occurs in the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COMMAND_PREPROCESS_BIT_EXT` pipeline stage.

* 
`VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_READ_NONCOHERENT_BIT_EXT` specifies read
access to [color attachments](renderpass.html#renderpass), including
[advanced blend operations](framebuffer.html#framebuffer-blend-advanced).
Such access occurs in the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT` pipeline stage.

* 
`VK_ACCESS_2_INVOCATION_MASK_READ_BIT_HUAWEI` specifies read access
to an invocation mask image in the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_INVOCATION_MASK_BIT_HUAWEI` pipeline stage.

* 
`VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_READ_BIT_KHR` specifies read
access to an acceleration structure as part of a trace, build, or copy
command, or to an [acceleration    structure scratch buffer](accelstructures.html#acceleration-structure-scratch) as part of a build command.
Such access occurs in the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_RAY_TRACING_SHADER_BIT_KHR` pipeline stage or
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR` pipeline
stage.

* 
`VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_WRITE_BIT_KHR` specifies write
access to an acceleration structure or [    acceleration structure scratch buffer](accelstructures.html#acceleration-structure-scratch) as part of a build or copy
command.
Such access occurs in the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR` pipeline
stage.

* 
`VK_ACCESS_FRAGMENT_DENSITY_MAP_READ_BIT_EXT` specifies read access
to a [fragment density map    attachment](renderpass.html#renderpass-fragmentdensitymapattachment) during dynamic [fragment density    map operations](fragmentdensitymapops.html#fragmentdensitymapops) Such access occurs in the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_DENSITY_PROCESS_BIT_EXT` pipeline stage.

* 
`VK_ACCESS_FRAGMENT_SHADING_RATE_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT_KHR` specifies
read access to a fragment shading rate attachment during rasterization.
Such access occurs in the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADING_RATE_ATTACHMENT_BIT_KHR`
pipeline stage.

* 
`VK_ACCESS_SHADING_RATE_IMAGE_READ_BIT_NV` specifies read access to
a shading rate image during rasterization.
Such access occurs in the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_SHADING_RATE_IMAGE_BIT_NV` pipeline stage.
It is equivalent to
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADING_RATE_ATTACHMENT_BIT_KHR`.

Certain access types are only performed by a subset of pipeline stages.
Any synchronization command that takes both stage masks and access masks
uses both to define the [access scopes](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) - only the specified access types performed by the specified stages
are included in the access scope.
An application **must** not specify an access flag in a synchronization command
if it does not include a pipeline stage in the corresponding stage mask that
is able to perform accesses of that type.
The following table lists, for each access flag, which pipeline stages **can**
perform that type of access.

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef VkFlags VkAccessFlags;

`VkAccessFlags` is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero or more
[VkAccessFlagBits](#VkAccessFlagBits).

If a memory object does not have the
`VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT` property, then
[vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges](memory.html#vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges) **must** be called in order to guarantee that
writes to the memory object from the host are made available to the host
domain, where they **can** be further made available to the device domain via a
domain operation.
Similarly, [vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges](memory.html#vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges) **must** be called to guarantee
that writes which are available to the host domain are made visible to host
operations.

If the memory object does have the
`VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT` property flag, writes to the
memory object from the host are automatically made available to the host
domain.
Similarly, writes made available to the host domain are automatically made
visible to the host.

|  | [Queue submission commands](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission) automatically
| --- | --- |
perform a [domain operation from host to device](#synchronization-submission-host-writes) for all writes performed before the command executes, so in
most cases an explicit memory barrier is not needed for this case.
In the few circumstances where a submit does not occur between the host
write and the device read access, writes **can** be made available by using an
explicit memory barrier. |

[Pipeline stages](#synchronization-pipeline-stages) that operate on, or
with respect to, the framebuffer are collectively the *framebuffer-space*
pipeline stages.
These stages are:

* 
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT`

* 
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_EARLY_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT`

* 
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_LATE_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT`

* 
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT`

For commands recorded where the
[per-tile execution model](renderpass.html#renderpass-per-tile-execution-model) is enabled,
the `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COMPUTE_SHADER_BIT` and
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_DRAW_INDIRECT_BIT` are included as framebuffer-space
pipeline stages.

For these pipeline stages, an execution or memory dependency from the first
set of operations to the second set **can** either be a single
*framebuffer-global* dependency, or split into multiple *framebuffer-local*
dependencies.
A dependency with non-framebuffer-space pipeline stages is neither
framebuffer-global nor framebuffer-local.

A *framebuffer region* is a subset of the entire framebuffer, and **can**
either be:

* 
A *sample region*, which is set of sample (x, y, layer, sample)
coordinates that is a subset of the entire framebuffer, or

* 
A *fragment region*, which is a set of fragment (x, y, layer)
coordinates that is a subset of the entire framebuffer.

Both [synchronization scopes](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) of a
framebuffer-local dependency include only the operations performed within
corresponding framebuffer regions (as defined below).
No ordering guarantees are made between different framebuffer regions for a
framebuffer-local dependency.

Both [synchronization scopes](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) of a
framebuffer-global dependency include operations on all framebuffer-regions.

If the first synchronization scope includes operations on pixels/fragments
with N samples and the second synchronization scope includes operations on
pixels/fragments with M samples, where N does not equal M, then a
framebuffer region containing all samples at a given (x, y, layer)
coordinate in the first synchronization scope corresponds to a region
containing all samples at the same coordinate in the second synchronization
scope.
In other words, the framebuffer region is a fragment region and it is a
pixel granularity dependency.
If N equals M,
and if the `VkSubpassDescription`::`flags` does not specify the
`VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_FRAGMENT_REGION_BIT_QCOM` flag,
then a framebuffer region containing a single (x, y, layer, sample)
coordinate in the first synchronization scope corresponds to a region
containing the same sample at the same coordinate in the second
synchronization scope.
In other words, the framebuffer region is a sample region and it is a sample
granularity dependency.

If the pipeline performing the operation was created with
`VK_PIPELINE_COLOR_BLEND_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_ACCESS_BIT_EXT`,
`VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_ACCESS_BIT_EXT`,
or
`VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_ACCESS_BIT_EXT`,
the framebuffer region is a fragment region and it is a pixel granularity
dependency.

For commands recorded within a render pass that enables
[tile shading](renderpass.html#renderpass-tile-shading), the framebuffer region is a tile
region and it is a tile granularity dependency.

|  | For commands recorded within a render pass instance that enables
| --- | --- |
[tile shading](renderpass.html#renderpass-tile-shading), the fragment shader invocations
for a given tile will be grouped together, but the tiles do not run in any
particular order, and the fragment shader invocations within a tile do not
run in any particular order.
Otherwise,
fragment shader invocations are not specified to run in any particular
groupings, the size of a framebuffer region is implementation-dependent, not
known to the application, and **must** be assumed to be no larger than
specified above. |

|  | Practically, the pixel vs. sample granularity dependency means that if an
| --- | --- |
input attachment has a different number of samples than the pipeline’s
`rasterizationSamples`, then a fragment **can** access any sample in the
input attachment’s pixel even if it only uses framebuffer-local
dependencies.
If the input attachment has the same number of samples, then the fragment
**can** only access the covered samples in its input `SampleMask` (i.e. the
fragment operations happen-after a framebuffer-local dependency for each
sample the fragment covers).
To access samples that are not covered,
either the `VkSubpassDescription`::`flags`
`VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_FRAGMENT_REGION_BIT_QCOM` flag is required, or
a framebuffer-global dependency is required.

For a tile granularity dependency, a fragment shader **can** use
[tile attachment variables](renderpass.html#renderpass-tile-shading-attachment-access) to
access any pixel or sample within the *active tile* for color, depth/stencil
or input attachments even if only framebuffer-local dependencies are used. |

If a synchronization command includes a `dependencyFlags` parameter, and
specifies the `VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT` flag, then it defines
framebuffer-local dependencies for the framebuffer-space pipeline stages in
that synchronization command, for all framebuffer regions.
If no `dependencyFlags` parameter is included, or the
`VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT` flag is not specified, then a
framebuffer-global dependency is specified for those stages.
The `VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT` flag does not affect the dependencies
between non-framebuffer-space pipeline stages, nor does it affect the
dependencies between framebuffer-space and non-framebuffer-space pipeline
stages.

|  | Framebuffer-local dependencies are more efficient for most architectures;
| --- | --- |
particularly tile-based architectures - which can keep framebuffer-regions
entirely in on-chip registers and thus avoid external bandwidth across such
a dependency.
Including a framebuffer-global dependency in your rendering will usually
force all implementations to flush data to memory, or to a higher level
cache, breaking any potential locality optimizations. |

In a render pass instance that has [multiview](renderpass.html#renderpass-multiview)
enabled, dependencies **can** be either view-local or view-global.

A view-local dependency only includes operations from a single
[source view](renderpass.html#renderpass-multiview-view-local) from the source subpass in
the first synchronization scope, and only includes operations from a single
[destination view](renderpass.html#renderpass-multiview-view-local) from the destination
subpass in the second synchronization scope.
A view-global dependency includes all views in the view mask of the source
and destination subpasses in the corresponding synchronization scopes.

If a synchronization command includes a `dependencyFlags` parameter and
specifies the `VK_DEPENDENCY_VIEW_LOCAL_BIT` flag, then it defines
view-local dependencies for that synchronization command, for all views.
If no `dependencyFlags` parameter is included or the
`VK_DEPENDENCY_VIEW_LOCAL_BIT` flag is not specified, then a view-global
dependency is specified.

Dependencies **can** be either device-local or non-device-local.
A device-local dependency acts as multiple separate dependencies, one for
each physical device that executes the synchronization command, where each
dependency only includes operations from that physical device in both
synchronization scopes.
A non-device-local dependency is a single dependency where both
synchronization scopes include operations from all physical devices that
participate in the synchronization command.
For subpass dependencies, all physical devices in the
[VkDeviceGroupRenderPassBeginInfo](renderpass.html#VkDeviceGroupRenderPassBeginInfo)::`deviceMask` participate in the
dependency, and for pipeline barriers all physical devices that are set in
the command buffer’s current device mask participate in the dependency.

If a synchronization command includes a `dependencyFlags` parameter and
specifies the `VK_DEPENDENCY_DEVICE_GROUP_BIT` flag, then it defines a
non-device-local dependency for that synchronization command.
If no `dependencyFlags` parameter is included or the
`VK_DEPENDENCY_DEVICE_GROUP_BIT` flag is not specified, then it defines
device-local dependencies for that synchronization command, for all
participating physical devices.

Semaphore and event dependencies are device-local and only execute on the
one physical device that performs the dependency.

A small number of implicit ordering guarantees are provided by Vulkan,
ensuring that the order in which commands are submitted is meaningful, and
avoiding unnecessary complexity in common operations.

*Submission order* is a fundamental ordering in Vulkan, giving meaning to
the order in which [action and synchronization commands](fundamentals.html#fundamentals-queueoperation-command-types) are recorded and submitted to a single queue.
Explicit and implicit ordering guarantees between commands in Vulkan all
work on the premise that this ordering is meaningful.
This order does not itself define any execution or memory dependencies;
synchronization commands and other orderings within the API use this
ordering to define their scopes.

Submission order for any given set of commands is based on the order in
which they were recorded to command buffers and then submitted.
This order is determined as follows:

The initial order is determined by the order in which
[vkQueueSubmit](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit)
and [vkQueueSubmit2](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit2)
commands are executed on the host, for a single queue, from first to
last.

The order in which [VkSubmitInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkSubmitInfo) structures are specified in the
`pSubmits` parameter of [vkQueueSubmit](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit),
or in which [VkSubmitInfo2](cmdbuffers.html#VkSubmitInfo2) structures are specified in the
`pSubmits` parameter of [vkQueueSubmit2](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit2),
from lowest index to highest.

The order in which command buffers are specified in the
`pCommandBuffers` member of [VkSubmitInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkSubmitInfo)
or [VkSubmitInfo2](cmdbuffers.html#VkSubmitInfo2)
from lowest index to highest.

The order in which commands outside of a render pass were recorded to a
command buffer on the host, from first to last.

The order in which commands inside a single subpass were recorded to a
command buffer on the host, from first to last.

|  | When using a [render pass object](renderpass.html#renderpass-objects) with multiple
| --- | --- |
subpasses, commands in different subpasses have no defined submission order
relative to each other, regardless of the order in which the subpasses were
recorded.
Commands within a subpass are still ordered relative to other commands in
the same subpass, and those outside of the render pass. |

[State commands](fundamentals.html#fundamentals-queueoperation-command-types) do not execute
any operations on the device, instead they set the state of the command
buffer when they execute on the host, in the order that they are recorded.
[Action commands](fundamentals.html#fundamentals-queueoperation-command-types) consume the
current state of the command buffer when they are recorded, and will execute
state changes on the device as required to match the recorded state.

[The order of primitives passing through the graphics pipeline](drawing.html#drawing-primitive-order) and
[image layout transitions as part of an image memory barrier](#synchronization-image-barrier-layout-transition-order) provide additional
guarantees based on submission order.

Execution of [pipeline stages](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-order)
within a given command also has a loose ordering, dependent only on a single
command.

*Signal operation order* is a fundamental ordering in Vulkan, giving meaning
to the order in which semaphore and fence signal operations occur when
submitted to a single queue.
The signal operation order for queue operations is determined as follows:

The initial order is determined by the order in which
[vkQueueSubmit](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit)
and [vkQueueSubmit2](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit2)
commands are executed on the host, for a single queue, from first to
last.

The order in which [VkSubmitInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkSubmitInfo) structures are specified in the
`pSubmits` parameter of [vkQueueSubmit](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit),
or in which [VkSubmitInfo2](cmdbuffers.html#VkSubmitInfo2) structures are specified in the
`pSubmits` parameter of [vkQueueSubmit2](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit2),
from lowest index to highest.

The fence signal operation defined by the `fence` parameter of a
    [vkQueueSubmit](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit)
or [vkQueueSubmit2](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit2)
or [vkQueueBindSparse](sparsemem.html#vkQueueBindSparse)
    command is ordered after all semaphore signal operations defined by that
    command.

Semaphore signal operations defined by a single [VkSubmitInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkSubmitInfo)
or [VkSubmitInfo2](cmdbuffers.html#VkSubmitInfo2)
or [VkBindSparseInfo](sparsemem.html#VkBindSparseInfo)
structure are unordered with respect to other semaphore signal operations
defined within the same structure.

The [vkSignalSemaphore](#vkSignalSemaphore) command does not execute on a queue but instead
performs the signal operation from the host.
The semaphore signal operation defined by executing a
[vkSignalSemaphore](#vkSignalSemaphore) command happens-after the [vkSignalSemaphore](#vkSignalSemaphore)
command is invoked and happens-before the command returns.

|  | When signaling timeline semaphores, it is the responsibility of the
| --- | --- |
application to ensure that they are ordered such that the semaphore value is
strictly increasing.
Because the first synchronization scope for a semaphore signal operation
contains all semaphore signal operations which occur earlier in submission
order, all semaphore signal operations contained in any given batch are
guaranteed to happen-after all semaphore signal operations contained in any
previous batches.
However, no ordering guarantee is provided between the semaphore signal
operations defined within a single batch.
This, combined with the requirement that timeline semaphore values strictly
increase, means that it is invalid to signal the same timeline semaphore
twice within a single batch.

If an application wishes to ensure that some semaphore signal operation
happens-after some other semaphore signal operation, it can submit a
separate batch containing only semaphore signal operations, which will
happen-after the semaphore signal operations in any earlier batches.

When signaling a semaphore from the host, the only ordering guarantee is
that the signal operation happens-after when [vkSignalSemaphore](#vkSignalSemaphore) is
called and happens-before it returns.
Therefore, it is invalid to call `vkSignalSemaphore` while there are any
outstanding signal operations on that semaphore from any queue submissions
unless those queue submissions have some dependency which ensures that they
happen-after the host signal operation.
One example of this would be if the pending signal operation is, itself,
waiting on the same semaphore at a lower value and the call to
`vkSignalSemaphore` signals that lower value.
Furthermore, if there are two or more processes or threads signaling the
same timeline semaphore from the host, the application must ensure that the
`vkSignalSemaphore` with the lower semaphore value returns before
`vkSignalSemaphore` is called with the higher value. |

Fences are a synchronization primitive that **can** be used to insert a
dependency from a queue to the host.
Fences have two states - signaled and unsignaled.
A fence **can** be signaled as part of the execution of a
[queue submission](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission) command.
Fences **can** be unsignaled on the host with [vkResetFences](#vkResetFences).
Fences **can** be waited on by the host with the [vkWaitForFences](#vkWaitForFences) command,
and the current state **can** be queried with [vkGetFenceStatus](#vkGetFenceStatus).

The internal data of a fence **may** include a reference to any resources and
pending work associated with signal or unsignal operations performed on that
fence object, collectively referred to as the fence’s *payload*.
Mechanisms to import and export that internal data to and from fences are
provided [below](#VkExportFenceCreateInfo).
These mechanisms indirectly enable applications to share fence state between
two or more fences and other synchronization primitives across process and
API boundaries.

Fences are represented by `VkFence` handles:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkFence)

To create a fence, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VkResult vkCreateFence(

    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator,
    VkFence*                                    pFence);

* 
`device` is the logical device that creates the fence.

* 
`pCreateInfo` is a pointer to a [VkFenceCreateInfo](#VkFenceCreateInfo) structure
containing information about how the fence is to be created.

`pAllocator` controls host memory allocation as described in the
[Memory Allocation](memory.html#memory-allocation) chapter.

the time `vkGetFenceFdKHR` is called, `pFd` **may** return the value
`-1` instead of a valid file descriptor.

* 
`device` is the logical device that owns the fence.

* 
`fence` is the handle of the fence to query.

Upon success, `vkGetFenceStatus` returns the status of the fence object,
with the following return codes:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `VK_SUCCESS` | The fence specified by `fence` is signaled. |
| `VK_NOT_READY` | The fence specified by `fence` is unsignaled. |

If a [queue submission](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission) command is pending
execution, then the value returned by this command **may** immediately be out
of date.

If the device has been lost (see [Lost Device](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-lost-device)),
`vkGetFenceStatus` **may** return any of the above status codes.
If the device has been lost and `vkGetFenceStatus` is called repeatedly,

unsignal operation* for each fence, which resets the fence to the unsignaled

When a fence is submitted to a queue as part of a
[queue submission](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission) command, it defines a memory
dependency on the batches that were submitted as part of that command, and
defines a *fence signal operation* which sets the fence to the signaled
state.

The first [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes every batch submitted in the same [queue submission](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission) command.
Fence signal operations that are defined by [vkQueueSubmit](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit)
or [vkQueueSubmit2](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit2)
additionally include in the first synchronization scope all commands that
occur earlier in [submission order](#synchronization-submission-order).
Fence signal operations that are defined by [vkQueueSubmit](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit)
or [vkQueueSubmit2](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit2)
or [vkQueueBindSparse](sparsemem.html#vkQueueBindSparse)
additionally include in the first synchronization scope any semaphore and
fence signal operations that occur earlier in
[signal operation order](#synchronization-signal-operation-order).

The second [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
only includes the fence signal operation.

The first [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes)
includes all memory access performed by the device.

The second [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) is
empty.

To wait for one or more fences to enter the signaled state on the host,
call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VkResult vkWaitForFences(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    uint32_t                                    fenceCount,
    const VkFence*                              pFences,
    VkBool32                                    waitAll,
    uint64_t                                    timeout);

* 
`device` is the logical device that owns the fences.

* 
`fenceCount` is the number of fences to wait on.

* 
`pFences` is a pointer to an array of `fenceCount` fence
handles.

* 
`waitAll` is the condition that **must** be satisfied to successfully
unblock the wait.
If `waitAll` is `VK_TRUE`, then the condition is that all fences
in `pFences` are signaled.
Otherwise, the condition is that at least one fence in `pFences` is
signaled.

* 
`timeout` is the timeout period in units of nanoseconds.
`timeout` is adjusted to the closest value allowed by the
implementation-dependent timeout accuracy, which **may** be substantially
longer than one nanosecond, and **may** be longer than the requested
period.

If the condition is satisfied when `vkWaitForFences` is called, then
`vkWaitForFences` returns immediately.
If the condition is not satisfied at the time `vkWaitForFences` is
called, then `vkWaitForFences` will block and wait until the condition
is satisfied or the `timeout` has expired, whichever is sooner.

If `timeout` is zero, then `vkWaitForFences` does not wait, but
simply returns the current state of the fences.
`VK_TIMEOUT` will be returned in this case if the condition is not
satisfied, even though no actual wait was performed.

If the condition is satisfied before the `timeout` has expired,
`vkWaitForFences` returns `VK_SUCCESS`.
Otherwise, `vkWaitForFences` returns `VK_TIMEOUT` after the
`timeout` has expired.

If device loss occurs (see [Lost Device](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-lost-device)) before
the timeout has expired, `vkWaitForFences` **must** return in finite time
with either `VK_SUCCESS` or `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`.

|  | While we guarantee that `vkWaitForFences` **must** return in finite time,
| --- | --- |
no guarantees are made that it returns immediately upon device loss.
However, the application can reasonably expect that the delay will be on the
order of seconds and that calling `vkWaitForFences` will not result in a
permanently (or seemingly permanently) dead process. |

Applications **can** import a fence payload into an existing fence using an
external fence handle.
The effects of the import operation will be either temporary or permanent,
as specified by the application.
If the import is temporary, the fence will be *restored* to its permanent
state the next time that fence is passed to [vkResetFences](#vkResetFences).

|  | Restoring a fence to its prior permanent payload is a distinct operation
| --- | --- |
from resetting a fence payload.
See [vkResetFences](#vkResetFences) for more detail. |

Performing a subsequent temporary import on a fence before resetting it has
no effect on this requirement; the next unsignal of the fence **must** still
restore its last permanent state.
A permanent payload import behaves as if the target fence was destroyed, and
a new fence was created with the same handle but the imported payload.
Because importing a fence payload temporarily or permanently detaches the
existing payload from a fence, similar usage restrictions to those applied
to `vkDestroyFence` are applied to any command that imports a fence
payload.
Which of these import types is used is referred to as the import operation’s
*permanence*.
Each handle type supports either one or both types of permanence.

The implementation **must** perform the import operation by either referencing
or copying the payload referred to by the specified external fence handle,
depending on the handle’s type.
The import method used is referred to as the handle type’s *transference*.
When using handle types with reference transference, importing a payload to
a fence adds the fence to the set of all fences sharing that payload.
This set includes the fence from which the payload was exported.
Fence signaling, waiting, and resetting operations performed on any fence in
the set **must** behave as if the set were a single fence.
Importing a payload using handle types with copy transference creates a
duplicate copy of the payload at the time of import, but makes no further
reference to it.
Fence signaling, waiting, and resetting operations performed on the target
of copy imports **must** not affect any other fence or payload.

Export operations have the same transference as the specified handle type’s
import operations.
Additionally, exporting a fence payload to a handle with copy transference
has the same side effects on the source fence’s payload as executing a fence
reset operation.
If the fence was using a temporarily imported payload, the fence’s prior
permanent payload will be restored.

|  | The
| --- | --- |
tables
[Handle Types Supported by `VkImportFenceWin32HandleInfoKHR`](#synchronization-fence-handletypes-win32)
and
[Handle Types Supported by `VkImportFenceFdInfoKHR`](#synchronization-fence-handletypes-fd)
define
the permanence and transference of each handle type. |

[External synchronization](fundamentals.html#fundamentals-threadingbehavior) allows
implementations to modify an object’s internal state, i.e. payload, without
internal synchronization.
However, for fences sharing a payload across processes, satisfying the
external synchronization requirements of `VkFence` parameters as if all
fences in the set were the same object is sometimes infeasible.
Satisfying valid usage constraints on the state of a fence would similarly
require impractical coordination or levels of trust between processes.
Therefore, these constraints only apply to a specific fence handle, not to
its payload.
For distinct fence objects which share a payload:

* 
If multiple commands which queue a signal operation, or which unsignal a
fence, are called concurrently, behavior will be as if the commands were
called in an arbitrary sequential order.

* 
If a queue submission command is called with a fence that is sharing a
payload, and the payload is already associated with another queue
command that has not yet completed execution, either one or both of the
commands will cause the fence to become signaled when they complete
execution.

* 
If a fence payload is reset while it is associated with a queue command
that has not yet completed execution, the payload will become
unsignaled, but **may** become signaled again when the command completes
execution.

* 
In the preceding cases, any of the devices associated with the fences
sharing the payload **may** be lost, or any of the queue submission or
fence reset commands **may** return `VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED`.

Other than these non-deterministic results, behavior is well defined.
In particular:

* 
The implementation **must** not crash or enter an internally inconsistent
state where future valid Vulkan commands might cause **undefined** results,

* 
Timeouts on future wait commands on fences sharing the payload **must** be
effective.

|  | These rules allow processes to synchronize access to shared memory without
| --- | --- |
trusting each other.
However, such processes must still be cautious not to use the shared fence
for more than synchronizing access to the shared memory.
For example, a process should not use a fence with shared payload to tell
when commands it submitted to a queue have completed and objects used by
those commands may be destroyed, since the other process can accidentally or
maliciously cause the fence to signal before the commands actually complete. |

When a fence is using an imported payload, its
[VkExportFenceCreateInfo](#VkExportFenceCreateInfo)::`handleTypes` value is specified when
creating the fence from which the payload was exported, rather than
specified when creating the fence.
Additionally,
[VkExternalFenceProperties](capabilities.html#VkExternalFenceProperties)::`exportFromImportedHandleTypes`
restricts which handle types **can** be exported from such a fence based on the
specific handle type used to import the current payload.
Passing a fence to [vkAcquireNextImageKHR](VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkAcquireNextImageKHR) is equivalent to temporarily
importing a fence payload to that fence.

|  | Because the exportable handle types of an imported fence correspond to its
| --- | --- |
current imported payload, and [vkAcquireNextImageKHR](VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkAcquireNextImageKHR) behaves the same
as a temporary import operation for which the source fence is opaque to the
application, applications have no way of determining whether any external
handle types **can** be exported from a fence in this state.
Therefore, applications **must** not attempt to export handles from fences
using a temporarily imported payload from [vkAcquireNextImageKHR](VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkAcquireNextImageKHR). |

When importing a fence payload, it is the responsibility of the application
to ensure the external handles meet all valid usage requirements.
However, implementations **must** perform sufficient validation of external
handles to ensure that the operation results in a valid fence which will not
cause program termination, device loss, queue stalls, host thread stalls, or
corruption of other resources when used as allowed according to its import
parameters.
If the external handle provided does not meet these requirements, the
implementation **must** fail the fence payload import operation with the error
code `VK_ERROR_INVALID_EXTERNAL_HANDLE`.

To import a fence payload from a Windows handle, call:

// Provided by VK_KHR_external_fence_win32
VkResult vkImportFenceWin32HandleKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkImportFenceWin32HandleInfoKHR*      pImportFenceWin32HandleInfo);

* 
`device` is the logical device that created the fence.

* 
`pImportFenceWin32HandleInfo` is a pointer to a
[VkImportFenceWin32HandleInfoKHR](#VkImportFenceWin32HandleInfoKHR) structure specifying the fence and
import parameters.

Importing a fence payload from Windows handles does not transfer ownership
of the handle to the Vulkan implementation.
For handle types defined as NT handles, the application **must** release
ownership using the `CloseHandle` system call when the handle is no
longer needed.

Applications **can** import the same fence payload into multiple instances of
Vulkan, into the same instance from which it was exported, and multiple
times into a given Vulkan instance.

Semaphores are a synchronization primitive that **can** be used to insert a
dependency
between queue operations or between a queue operation and the host.
[Binary semaphores](../appendices/glossary.html#glossary) have two states - signaled and unsignaled.
[Timeline semaphores](../appendices/glossary.html#glossary) have a strictly increasing 64-bit unsigned
integer payload and are signaled with respect to a particular reference
value.
A semaphore **can** be signaled after execution of a queue operation is
completed, and a queue operation **can** wait for a semaphore to become
signaled before it begins execution.
A timeline semaphore **can** additionally be signaled from the host with the
[vkSignalSemaphore](#vkSignalSemaphore) command and waited on from the host with the
[vkWaitSemaphores](#vkWaitSemaphores) command.

The internal data of a semaphore **may** include a reference to any resources
and pending work associated with signal or unsignal operations performed on
that semaphore object, collectively referred to as the semaphore’s
*payload*.
Mechanisms to import and export that internal data to and from semaphores
are provided [below](#VkExportSemaphoreCreateInfo).
These mechanisms indirectly enable applications to share semaphore state
between two or more semaphores and other synchronization primitives across
process and API boundaries.

Semaphores are represented by `VkSemaphore` handles:

`VkExportSemaphoreWin32HandleInfoKHR` is not included in the `pNext`
chain, or it is included but `pAttributes` is `NULL`, default security
descriptor values will be used, and child processes created by the
application will not inherit the handle, as described in the MSDN
documentation for “Synchronization Object Security and Access Rights”1.
Further, if the structure is not present, the access rights used depend on
the handle type.

For handles of the following types:

`VK_EXTERNAL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_TYPE_OPAQUE_WIN32_BIT`

The implementation **must** ensure the access rights allow both signal and wait
operations on the semaphore.

For handles of the following types:

`VK_EXTERNAL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_TYPE_D3D12_FENCE_BIT`

The access rights **must** be:

`GENERIC_ALL`

When a batch is submitted to a queue via a [queue submission](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission), and it includes semaphores to be signaled, it defines a memory
dependency on the batch, and defines *semaphore signal operations* which set
the semaphores to the signaled state.

In case of semaphores created with a [VkSemaphoreType](#VkSemaphoreType) of
`VK_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_TIMELINE` the semaphore is considered signaled with
respect to the counter value set to be signaled as specified in
[VkTimelineSemaphoreSubmitInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkTimelineSemaphoreSubmitInfo) or [VkSemaphoreSignalInfo](#VkSemaphoreSignalInfo).

The first [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes every command submitted in the same batch.
In the case of [vkQueueSubmit2](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit2), the first synchronization scope is
limited to the pipeline stage specified by
[VkSemaphoreSubmitInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkSemaphoreSubmitInfo)::`stageMask`.
Semaphore signal operations that are defined by [vkQueueSubmit](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit)
or [vkQueueSubmit2](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit2)

Semaphore signal operations that are defined by [vkQueueSubmit](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit)
or [vkQueueSubmit2](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit2)
or [vkQueueBindSparse](sparsemem.html#vkQueueBindSparse)
additionally include in the first synchronization scope any semaphore and
fence signal operations that occur earlier in
[signal operation order](#synchronization-signal-operation-order).

The second [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes only the semaphore signal operation.

The first [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes)
includes all memory access performed by the device.

The second [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) is
empty.

When a batch is submitted to a queue via a [queue submission](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission), and it includes semaphores to be waited on, it defines a
memory dependency between prior semaphore signal operations and the batch,
and defines *semaphore wait operations*.

Such semaphore wait operations set the semaphores
created with a [VkSemaphoreType](#VkSemaphoreType) of `VK_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY`
to the unsignaled state.
In case of semaphores created with a [VkSemaphoreType](#VkSemaphoreType) of
`VK_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_TIMELINE` a prior semaphore signal operation defines
a memory dependency with a semaphore wait operation if the value the
semaphore is signaled with is greater than or equal to the value the
semaphore is waited with, thus the semaphore will continue to be considered
signaled with respect to the counter value waited on as specified in
[VkTimelineSemaphoreSubmitInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkTimelineSemaphoreSubmitInfo).

The first [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes one [semaphore signal operation](#synchronization-semaphores-signaling) for each semaphore waited on by this batch.
The specific signal operation waited on for each semaphore **must** meet the
following criteria:

* 

for binary semaphores,
the signal operation is either earlier in
[submission order](#synchronization-submission-order) on the same queue,
or is submitted by a command whose host operation happens-before this
batch is submitted on the host

* 

for binary semaphores,
no wait operation exists that happens-after the signal operation and
happens-before this wait operation

* 
the signal operation is not guaranteed to happen-after the semaphore
wait operation in this batch

* 
for timeline semaphores, the signal value is greater than or equal to
the wait value

If multiple semaphore signal operations meet these criteria, any of those
operations **may** be included in the first
[synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes).
When waiting on a binary semaphore, applications **must** ensure that exactly
one semaphore signal operation meets these criteria.

The second [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes every command submitted in the same batch.
In the case of [vkQueueSubmit](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit), the second synchronization scope is
limited to operations on the pipeline stages determined by the
[destination stage mask](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-masks) specified
by the corresponding element of `pWaitDstStageMask`.
In the case of [vkQueueSubmit2](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit2), the second synchronization scope is
limited to the pipeline stage specified by
[VkSemaphoreSubmitInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkSemaphoreSubmitInfo)::`stageMask`.
Also, in the case of
either [vkQueueSubmit2](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit2) or
[vkQueueSubmit](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit), the second synchronization scope additionally includes
all commands that occur later in
[submission order](#synchronization-submission-order).

The first [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) is
empty.

The second [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes)
includes all memory access performed by the device.

The semaphore wait operation happens-after the first set of operations in
the execution dependency, and happens-before the second set of operations in
the execution dependency.

|  | Unlike
| --- | --- |
timeline semaphores,
fences or events, waiting for a binary semaphore also unsignals that
semaphore when the wait completes.
Applications **must** ensure that between two such wait operations, the
semaphore is signaled again, with execution dependencies used to ensure
these occur in order.
Binary semaphore waits and signals should thus occur in discrete 1:1 pairs. |

|  | A common scenario for using `pWaitDstStageMask` with values other than
| --- | --- |
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT` is when synchronizing a window
system presentation operation against subsequent command buffers which
render the next frame.
In this case, a presentation image **must** not be overwritten until the
presentation operation completes, but other pipeline stages **can** execute
without waiting.
A mask of `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT` prevents
subsequent color attachment writes from executing until the semaphore
signals.
Some implementations **may** be able to execute transfer operations and/or
pre-rasterization work before the semaphore is signaled.

If an image layout transition needs to be performed on a presentable image
before it is used in a framebuffer, that **can** be performed as the first
operation submitted to the queue after acquiring the image, and **should** not
prevent other work from overlapping with the presentation operation.
For example, a `VkImageMemoryBarrier` could use:

* 
`srcStageMask` = `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT`

* 
`srcAccessMask` = 0

* 
`dstStageMask` = `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT`

* 
`dstAccessMask` = `VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT` \|
`VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT`.

* 
`oldLayout` = `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR`

* 
`newLayout` = `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`

Alternatively, `oldLayout` **can** be `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED`, if
the image’s contents need not be preserved.

This barrier accomplishes a dependency chain between previous presentation
operations and subsequent color attachment output operations, with the
layout transition performed in between, and does not introduce a dependency
between previous work and any
[pre-rasterization shader stage](pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization)s.
More precisely, the semaphore signals after the presentation operation
completes, the semaphore wait stalls the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT` stage, and there is a
dependency from that same stage to itself with the layout transition
performed in between. |

Before waiting on a semaphore, the application **must** ensure the semaphore is
in a valid state for a wait operation.
Specifically, when a [semaphore wait operation](#synchronization-semaphores-waiting) is submitted to a queue:

* 
A binary semaphore **must** be signaled, or have an associated
[semaphore signal operation](#synchronization-semaphores-signaling) that
is pending execution.

* 
Any [semaphore signal operations](#synchronization-semaphores-signaling)
on which the pending binary semaphore signal operation depends **must**
also be completed or pending execution.

* 
There **must** be no other queue waiting on the same binary semaphore when
the operation executes.

In addition to [semaphore signal operations](#synchronization-semaphores-signaling) and [semaphore wait operations](#synchronization-semaphores-waiting) submitted to device queues, timeline semaphores support the
following host operations:

* 
Query the current counter value of the semaphore using the
[vkGetSemaphoreCounterValue](#vkGetSemaphoreCounterValue) command.

* 
Wait for a set of semaphores to reach particular counter values using
the [vkWaitSemaphores](#vkWaitSemaphores) command.

* 
Signal the semaphore with a particular counter value from the host using
the [vkSignalSemaphore](#vkSignalSemaphore) command.

To query the current counter value of a semaphore created with a
[VkSemaphoreType](#VkSemaphoreType) of `VK_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_TIMELINE` from the host,
call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2
VkResult vkGetSemaphoreCounterValue(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkSemaphore                                 semaphore,
    uint64_t*                                   pValue);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore
VkResult vkGetSemaphoreCounterValueKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkSemaphore                                 semaphore,
    uint64_t*                                   pValue);

* 
`device` is the logical device that owns the semaphore.

* 
`semaphore` is the handle of the semaphore to query.

* 
`pValue` is a pointer to a 64-bit integer value in which the current
counter value of the semaphore is returned.

`timeout` is the timeout period in units of nanoseconds.
`timeout` is adjusted to the closest value allowed by the
implementation-dependent timeout accuracy, which **may** be substantially
longer than one nanosecond, and **may** be longer than the requested

If the condition is satisfied when `vkWaitSemaphores` is called, then
`vkWaitSemaphores` returns immediately.
If the condition is not satisfied at the time `vkWaitSemaphores` is
called, then `vkWaitSemaphores` will block and wait until the condition
is satisfied or the `timeout` has expired, whichever is sooner.

If `timeout` is zero, then `vkWaitSemaphores` does not wait, but
simply returns information about the current state of the semaphores.
`VK_TIMEOUT` will be returned in this case if the condition is not
satisfied, even though no actual wait was performed.

If the condition is satisfied before the `timeout` has expired,
`vkWaitSemaphores` returns `VK_SUCCESS`.
Otherwise, `vkWaitSemaphores` returns `VK_TIMEOUT` after the
`timeout` has expired.

If device loss occurs (see [Lost Device](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-lost-device)) before
the timeout has expired, `vkWaitSemaphores` **must** return in finite time

 `semaphore` **must** be a valid [VkSemaphore](#VkSemaphore) handle

Applications **can** import a semaphore payload into an existing semaphore
using an external semaphore handle.
The effects of the import operation will be either temporary or permanent,
as specified by the application.
If the import is temporary, the implementation **must** restore the semaphore
to its prior permanent state after submitting the next semaphore wait
operation.
Performing a subsequent temporary import on a semaphore before performing a
semaphore wait has no effect on this requirement; the next wait submitted on
the semaphore **must** still restore its last permanent state.
A permanent payload import behaves as if the target semaphore was destroyed,
and a new semaphore was created with the same handle but the imported
payload.
Because importing a semaphore payload temporarily or permanently detaches
the existing payload from a semaphore, similar usage restrictions to those
applied to `vkDestroySemaphore` are applied to any command that imports
a semaphore payload.
Which of these import types is used is referred to as the import operation’s
*permanence*.
Each handle type supports either one or both types of permanence.

The implementation **must** perform the import operation by either referencing
or copying the payload referred to by the specified external semaphore
handle, depending on the handle’s type.
The import method used is referred to as the handle type’s *transference*.
When using handle types with reference transference, importing a payload to
a semaphore adds the semaphore to the set of all semaphores sharing that
payload.
This set includes the semaphore from which the payload was exported.
Semaphore signaling and waiting operations performed on any semaphore in the
set **must** behave as if the set were a single semaphore.
Importing a payload using handle types with copy transference creates a
duplicate copy of the payload at the time of import, but makes no further
reference to it.
Semaphore signaling and waiting operations performed on the target of copy
imports **must** not affect any other semaphore or payload.

Export operations have the same transference as the specified handle type’s
import operations.
Additionally, exporting a semaphore payload to a handle with copy
transference has the same side effects on the source semaphore’s payload as
executing a semaphore wait operation.
If the semaphore was using a temporarily imported payload, the semaphore’s
prior permanent payload will be restored.

|  | The permanence and transference of handle types can be found in:
| --- | --- |

[Handle Types Supported    by `VkImportSemaphoreZirconHandleInfoFUCHSIA`](#synchronization-semaphore-handletypes-fuchsia) |

[External synchronization](fundamentals.html#fundamentals-threadingbehavior) allows
implementations to modify an object’s internal state, i.e. payload, without
internal synchronization.
However, for semaphores sharing a payload across processes, satisfying the
external synchronization requirements of `VkSemaphore` parameters as if
all semaphores in the set were the same object is sometimes infeasible.
Satisfying the [wait operation state requirements](#synchronization-semaphores-waiting-state) would similarly require impractical coordination or
levels of trust between processes.
Therefore, these constraints only apply to a specific semaphore handle, not
to its payload.
For distinct semaphore objects which share a payload, if the semaphores are
passed to separate queue submission commands concurrently, behavior will be
as if the commands were called in an arbitrary sequential order.
If the [wait operation state requirements](#synchronization-semaphores-waiting-state) are violated for the shared payload by a queue submission
command, or if a signal operation is queued for a shared payload that is
already signaled or has a pending signal operation, effects **must** be limited
to one or more of the following:

* 
Returning `VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` from the command which
resulted in the violation.

* 
Losing the logical device on which the violation occurred immediately or
at a future time, resulting in a `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` error from
subsequent commands, including the one causing the violation.

* 
Continuing execution of the violating command or operation as if the
semaphore wait completed successfully after an implementation-dependent
timeout.
In this case, the state of the payload becomes **undefined**, and future
operations on semaphores sharing the payload will be subject to these
same rules.
The semaphore **must** be destroyed or have its payload replaced by an
import operation to again have a well-defined state.

|  | These rules allow processes to synchronize access to shared memory without
| --- | --- |
trusting each other.
However, such processes must still be cautious not to use the shared
semaphore for more than synchronizing access to the shared memory.
For example, a process should not use a shared semaphore as part of an
execution dependency chain that, when complete, leads to objects being
destroyed, if it does not trust other processes sharing the semaphore
payload. |

When a semaphore is using an imported payload, its
[VkExportSemaphoreCreateInfo](#VkExportSemaphoreCreateInfo)::`handleTypes` value is specified when
creating the semaphore from which the payload was exported, rather than
specified when creating the semaphore.
Additionally,
[VkExternalSemaphoreProperties](capabilities.html#VkExternalSemaphoreProperties)::`exportFromImportedHandleTypes`
restricts which handle types **can** be exported from such a semaphore based on
the specific handle type used to import the current payload.
Passing a semaphore to [vkAcquireNextImageKHR](VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkAcquireNextImageKHR) is equivalent to
temporarily importing a semaphore payload to that semaphore.

|  | Because the exportable handle types of an imported semaphore correspond to
| --- | --- |
its current imported payload, and [vkAcquireNextImageKHR](VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkAcquireNextImageKHR) behaves the
same as a temporary import operation for which the source semaphore is
opaque to the application, applications have no way of determining whether
any external handle types **can** be exported from a semaphore in this state.
Therefore, applications **must** not attempt to export external handles from
semaphores using a temporarily imported payload from
[vkAcquireNextImageKHR](VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkAcquireNextImageKHR). |

When importing a semaphore payload, it is the responsibility of the
application to ensure the external handles meet all valid usage
requirements.
However, implementations **must** perform sufficient validation of external
handles to ensure that the operation results in a valid semaphore which will
not cause program termination, device loss, queue stalls, or corruption of
other resources when used as allowed according to its import parameters, and
excepting those side effects allowed for violations of the
[valid semaphore state for wait operations](#synchronization-semaphores-waiting-state) rules.
If the external handle provided does not meet these requirements, the
implementation **must** fail the semaphore payload import operation with the
error code `VK_ERROR_INVALID_EXTERNAL_HANDLE`.

In addition, when importing a semaphore payload that is not compatible with
the payload type corresponding to the [VkSemaphoreType](#VkSemaphoreType) the semaphore
was created with, the implementation **may** fail the semaphore payload import
operation with the error code `VK_ERROR_INVALID_EXTERNAL_HANDLE`.

|  | As the introduction of the external semaphore handle type
| --- | --- |
`VK_EXTERNAL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_TYPE_D3D12_FENCE_BIT` predates that of
timeline semaphores, support for importing semaphore payloads from external
handles of that type into semaphores created (implicitly or explicitly) with
a [VkSemaphoreType](#VkSemaphoreType) of `VK_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY` is preserved for

However, applications **should** prefer importing such handle types into
semaphores created with a [VkSemaphoreType](#VkSemaphoreType) of
`VK_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_TIMELINE`. |

To import a semaphore payload from a Windows handle, call:

// Provided by VK_KHR_external_semaphore_win32
VkResult vkImportSemaphoreWin32HandleKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkImportSemaphoreWin32HandleInfoKHR*  pImportSemaphoreWin32HandleInfo);

* 
`device` is the logical device that created the semaphore.

* 
`pImportSemaphoreWin32HandleInfo` is a pointer to a
[VkImportSemaphoreWin32HandleInfoKHR](#VkImportSemaphoreWin32HandleInfoKHR) structure specifying the
semaphore and import parameters.

Importing a semaphore payload from Windows handles does not transfer
ownership of the handle to the Vulkan implementation.
For handle types defined as NT handles, the application **must** release
ownership using the `CloseHandle` system call when the handle is no
longer needed.

Applications **can** import the same semaphore payload into multiple instances
of Vulkan, into the same instance from which it was exported, and multiple
times into a given Vulkan instance.

Events are a synchronization primitive that **can** be used to insert a
fine-grained dependency between commands submitted to the same queue, or
between the host and a queue.
Events **must** not be used to insert a dependency between commands submitted
to different queues.
Events have two states - signaled and unsignaled.
An application **can** signal or unsignal an event either on the host or on the
device.
A device **can** be made to wait for an event to become signaled before
executing further operations.
No command exists to wait for an event to become signaled on the host, but
the current state of an event **can** be queried.

Events are represented by `VkEvent` handles:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkEvent)

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VkResult vkCreateEvent(

    VkEvent*                                    pEvent);

* 
`device` is the logical device that creates the event.

* 
`pCreateInfo` is a pointer to a [VkEventCreateInfo](#VkEventCreateInfo) structure
containing information about how the event is to be created.

* 
`pAllocator` controls host memory allocation as described in the
[Memory Allocation](memory.html#memory-allocation) chapter.

* 
`pEvent` is a pointer to a handle in which the resulting event
object is returned.

When created, the event object is in the unsignaled state.

Host Synchronization

* 
Host access to `event` **must** be externally synchronized

To query the state of an event from the host, call:

* 
`device` is the logical device that owns the event.

* 
`event` is the handle of the event to query.

Upon success, `vkGetEventStatus` returns the state of the event object
with the following return codes:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `VK_EVENT_SET` | The event specified by `event` is signaled. |
| `VK_EVENT_RESET` | The event specified by `event` is unsignaled. |

If a `vkCmdSetEvent` or `vkCmdResetEvent` command is in a command
buffer that is in the [pending state](cmdbuffers.html#commandbuffers-lifecycle), then the
value returned by this command **may** immediately be out of date.

The state of an event **can** be updated by the host.
The state of the event is immediately changed, and subsequent calls to
`vkGetEventStatus` will return the new state.
If an event is already in the requested state, then updating it to the same
state has no effect.

The state of an event **can** also be updated on the device by commands
inserted in command buffers.

To signal an event from a device, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
void vkCmdSetEvent2(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkEvent                                     event,

    const VkDependencyInfo*                     pDependencyInfo);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command is
recorded.

* 
`event` is the event that will be signaled.

* 
`pDependencyInfo` is a pointer to a [VkDependencyInfo](#VkDependencyInfo) structure
defining the first scopes of this operation.

When [vkCmdSetEvent2](#vkCmdSetEvent2) is submitted to a queue, it defines the first half
of memory dependencies defined by `pDependencyInfo`, as well as an event
signal operation which sets the event to the signaled state.
A memory dependency is defined between the event signal operation and
commands that occur earlier in submission order.

The first [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) and
[access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) are defined by
the union of all the memory dependencies defined by `pDependencyInfo`,
and are applied to all operations that occur earlier in
[submission order](#synchronization-submission-order).
[Queue family ownership transfers](#synchronization-queue-transfers) and
[image layout transitions](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions)
defined by `pDependencyInfo` are also included in the first scopes.

The second [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes only the event signal operation, and any
[queue family ownership transfers](#synchronization-queue-transfers) and
[image layout transitions](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions)
defined by `pDependencyInfo`.

The second [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes)
includes only [queue family ownership transfers](#synchronization-queue-transfers) and [image layout transitions](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions).

Future [vkCmdWaitEvents2](#vkCmdWaitEvents2) commands rely on all values of each element in
`pDependencyInfo` matching exactly with those used to signal the
corresponding event.
[vkCmdWaitEvents](#vkCmdWaitEvents) **must** not be used to wait on the result of a signal
operation defined by `vkCmdSetEvent2`.

|  | The extra information provided by [vkCmdSetEvent2](#vkCmdSetEvent2) compared to
| --- | --- |
[vkCmdSetEvent](#vkCmdSetEvent) allows implementations to more efficiently schedule the
operations required to satisfy the requested dependencies.
With [vkCmdSetEvent](#vkCmdSetEvent), the full dependency information is not known until
[vkCmdWaitEvents](#vkCmdWaitEvents) is recorded, forcing implementations to insert the
required operations at that point and not before. |

If `event` is already in the signaled state when [vkCmdSetEvent2](#vkCmdSetEvent2) is
executed on the device, then [vkCmdSetEvent2](#vkCmdSetEvent2) has no effect, no event
signal operation occurs, and no dependency is generated.

To unsignal the event from a device, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
void vkCmdResetEvent2(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkEvent                                     event,
    VkPipelineStageFlags2                       stageMask);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_synchronization2
void vkCmdResetEvent2KHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkEvent                                     event,
    VkPipelineStageFlags2                       stageMask);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command is
recorded.

* 
`event` is the event that will be unsignaled.

* 
`stageMask` is a [VkPipelineStageFlags2](#VkPipelineStageFlags2) mask of pipeline stages
used to determine the first [    synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes).

When [vkCmdResetEvent2](#vkCmdResetEvent2) is submitted to a queue, it defines an execution
dependency on commands that were submitted before it, and defines an event
unsignal operation which resets the event to the unsignaled state.

The first [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes all commands that occur earlier in
[submission order](#synchronization-submission-order).
The synchronization scope is limited to operations by `stageMask` or
stages that are [logically earlier](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-order)
than `stageMask`.

The second [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes only the event unsignal operation.

If `event` is already in the unsignaled state when
[vkCmdResetEvent2](#vkCmdResetEvent2) is executed on the device, then this command has no
effect, no event unsignal operation occurs, and no execution dependency is
generated.

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command is
recorded.

* 
`eventCount` is the length of the `pEvents` array.

* 
`pEvents` is a pointer to an array of `eventCount` events to
wait on.

* 
`pDependencyInfos` is a pointer to an array of `eventCount`
[VkDependencyInfo](#VkDependencyInfo) structures, defining the second
[synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes).

When `vkCmdWaitEvents2` is submitted to a queue, it inserts memory
dependencies according to the elements of `pDependencyInfos` and each
corresponding element of `pEvents`.
`vkCmdWaitEvents2` **must** not be used to wait on event signal operations
occurring on other queues, or signal operations executed by
[vkCmdSetEvent](#vkCmdSetEvent).

The first [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) and
[access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) of each memory
dependency defined by any element i of `pDependencyInfos` are
applied to operations that occurred earlier in
[submission order](#synchronization-submission-order) than the last event
signal operation on element i of `pEvents`.

Signal operations for an event at index i are only included if:

* 
The event was signaled by a [vkCmdSetEvent2](#vkCmdSetEvent2) command that occurred
earlier in [submission order](#synchronization-submission-order) with a
`dependencyInfo` parameter exactly equal to the element of
`pDependencyInfos` at index i ; or

* 
The event was created without `VK_EVENT_CREATE_DEVICE_ONLY_BIT`, and
the first [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
defined by the element of `pDependencyInfos` at index i only
includes host operations (`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_HOST_BIT`).

The second [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
and [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) of each
memory dependency defined by any element i of `pDependencyInfos`
are applied to operations that occurred later in
[submission order](#synchronization-submission-order) than
`vkCmdWaitEvents2`.

|  | [vkCmdWaitEvents2](#vkCmdWaitEvents2) is used with [vkCmdSetEvent2](#vkCmdSetEvent2) to define a memory
| --- | --- |
dependency between two sets of action commands, roughly in the same way as
pipeline barriers, but split into two commands such that work between the
two **may** execute unhindered. |

|  | Applications should be careful to avoid race conditions when using events.

There is no direct ordering guarantee between `vkCmdSetEvent2` and
[vkCmdResetEvent2](#vkCmdResetEvent2), [vkCmdResetEvent](#vkCmdResetEvent), or [vkCmdSetEvent](#vkCmdSetEvent).
Another execution dependency (e.g. a pipeline barrier or semaphore with
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT`) is needed to prevent such a race
condition. |

To wait for one or more events to enter the signaled state on a device,
call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
void vkCmdWaitEvents(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    eventCount,
    const VkEvent*                              pEvents,
    VkPipelineStageFlags                        srcStageMask,
    VkPipelineStageFlags                        dstStageMask,
    uint32_t                                    memoryBarrierCount,
    const VkMemoryBarrier*                      pMemoryBarriers,
    uint32_t                                    bufferMemoryBarrierCount,
    const VkBufferMemoryBarrier*                pBufferMemoryBarriers,
    uint32_t                                    imageMemoryBarrierCount,
    const VkImageMemoryBarrier*                 pImageMemoryBarriers);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command is
recorded.

* 
`eventCount` is the length of the `pEvents` array.

* 
`pEvents` is a pointer to an array of event object handles to wait
on.

* 
`srcStageMask` is a bitmask of [VkPipelineStageFlagBits](#VkPipelineStageFlagBits)
specifying the [source stage mask](#synchronization-pipeline-stages).

* 
`dstStageMask` is a bitmask of [VkPipelineStageFlagBits](#VkPipelineStageFlagBits)
specifying the [destination stage    mask](#synchronization-pipeline-stages).

* 
`memoryBarrierCount` is the length of the `pMemoryBarriers`
array.

* 
`pMemoryBarriers` is a pointer to an array of [VkMemoryBarrier](#VkMemoryBarrier)
structures.

* 
`bufferMemoryBarrierCount` is the length of the
`pBufferMemoryBarriers` array.

* 
`pBufferMemoryBarriers` is a pointer to an array of
[VkBufferMemoryBarrier](#VkBufferMemoryBarrier) structures.

* 
`imageMemoryBarrierCount` is the length of the
`pImageMemoryBarriers` array.

* 
`pImageMemoryBarriers` is a pointer to an array of
[VkImageMemoryBarrier](#VkImageMemoryBarrier) structures.

`vkCmdWaitEvents` is largely similar to [vkCmdWaitEvents2](#vkCmdWaitEvents2), but **can**
only wait on signal operations defined by [vkCmdSetEvent](#vkCmdSetEvent).
As [vkCmdSetEvent](#vkCmdSetEvent) does not define any access scopes,
`vkCmdWaitEvents` defines the first access scope for each event signal
operation in addition to its own access scopes.

|  | Since [vkCmdSetEvent](#vkCmdSetEvent) does not have any dependency information beyond a
| --- | --- |
stage mask, implementations do not have the same opportunity to perform
[availability and visibility operations](#synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible) or [image layout transitions](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions) in advance as they do with [vkCmdSetEvent2](#vkCmdSetEvent2) and
[vkCmdWaitEvents2](#vkCmdWaitEvents2). |

When `vkCmdWaitEvents` is submitted to a queue, it defines a memory
dependency between prior event signal operations on the same queue or the
host, and subsequent commands.
`vkCmdWaitEvents` **must** not be used to wait on event signal operations
occurring on other queues.

The first synchronization scope only includes event signal operations that
operate on members of `pEvents`, and the operations that happened-before
the event signal operations.
Event signal operations performed by [vkCmdSetEvent](#vkCmdSetEvent) that occur earlier
in [submission order](#synchronization-submission-order) are included in the
first synchronization scope, if the [logically latest](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-order) pipeline stage in their `stageMask` parameter is
[logically earlier](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-order) than or equal
to the [logically latest](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-order) pipeline
stage in `srcStageMask`.
Event signal operations performed by [vkSetEvent](#vkSetEvent) are only included in
the first synchronization scope if `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_HOST_BIT` is
included in `srcStageMask`.

The second [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes all commands that occur later in
[submission order](#synchronization-submission-order).
The second synchronization scope is limited to operations on the pipeline
stages determined by the [destination stage mask](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-masks) specified by `dstStageMask`.

The first [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) is
limited to accesses in the pipeline stages determined by the
[source stage mask](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-masks) specified by
`srcStageMask`.
Within that, the first access scope only includes the first access scopes
defined by elements of the `pMemoryBarriers`,
`pBufferMemoryBarriers` and `pImageMemoryBarriers` arrays, which
each define a set of [memory barriers](#synchronization-memory-barriers).
If no memory barriers are specified, then the first access scope includes no
accesses.

The second [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) is
limited to accesses in the pipeline stages determined by the
[destination stage mask](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-masks) specified
by `dstStageMask`.
Within that, the second access scope only includes the second access scopes
defined by elements of the `pMemoryBarriers`,
`pBufferMemoryBarriers` and `pImageMemoryBarriers` arrays, which
each define a set of [memory barriers](#synchronization-memory-barriers).
If no memory barriers are specified, then the second access scope includes
no accesses.

To record a pipeline barrier, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
void vkCmdPipelineBarrier2(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkDependencyInfo*                     pDependencyInfo);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_synchronization2
void vkCmdPipelineBarrier2KHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkDependencyInfo*                     pDependencyInfo);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command is
recorded.

* 
`pDependencyInfo` is a pointer to a [VkDependencyInfo](#VkDependencyInfo) structure
defining the scopes of this operation.

When [vkCmdPipelineBarrier2](#vkCmdPipelineBarrier2) is submitted to a queue, it defines memory
dependencies between commands that were submitted to the same queue before
it, and those submitted to the same queue after it.

The first [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) and
[access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) of each memory
dependency defined by `pDependencyInfo` are applied to operations that
occurred earlier in [submission order](#synchronization-submission-order).

The second [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
and [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) of each
memory dependency defined by `pDependencyInfo` are applied to operations
that occurred later in [submission order](#synchronization-submission-order).

If `vkCmdPipelineBarrier2` is recorded within a render pass instance,
the synchronization scopes are limited to a subset of operations within the
same subpass or render pass instance.

`vkCmdPipelineBarrier` operates almost identically to
[vkCmdPipelineBarrier2](#vkCmdPipelineBarrier2), except that the scopes and barriers are defined
as direct parameters rather than being defined by a [VkDependencyInfo](#VkDependencyInfo).

When [vkCmdPipelineBarrier](#vkCmdPipelineBarrier) is submitted to a queue, it defines a memory
dependency between commands that were submitted to the same queue before it,
and those submitted to the same queue after it.

If [vkCmdPipelineBarrier](#vkCmdPipelineBarrier) was recorded outside a render pass instance,
the first [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes all commands that occur earlier in
[submission order](#synchronization-submission-order).
If [vkCmdPipelineBarrier](#vkCmdPipelineBarrier) was recorded inside a render pass instance,
the first synchronization scope includes only commands that occur earlier in
[submission order](#synchronization-submission-order) within the same
subpass.
In either case, the first synchronization scope is limited to operations on
the pipeline stages determined by the
[source stage mask](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-masks) specified by
`srcStageMask`.

If [vkCmdPipelineBarrier](#vkCmdPipelineBarrier) was recorded outside a render pass instance,
the second [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes all commands that occur later in
[submission order](#synchronization-submission-order).
If [vkCmdPipelineBarrier](#vkCmdPipelineBarrier) was recorded inside a render pass instance,
the second synchronization scope includes only commands that occur later in
[submission order](#synchronization-submission-order) within the same
subpass.
In either case, the second synchronization scope is limited to operations on
the pipeline stages determined by the
[destination stage mask](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-masks) specified
by `dstStageMask`.

The first [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) is
limited to accesses in the pipeline stages determined by the
[source stage mask](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-masks) specified by
`srcStageMask`.
Within that, the first access scope only includes the first access scopes
defined by elements of the `pMemoryBarriers`,
`pBufferMemoryBarriers` and `pImageMemoryBarriers` arrays, which
each define a set of [memory barriers](#synchronization-memory-barriers).
If no memory barriers are specified, then the first access scope includes no
accesses.

The second [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) is
limited to accesses in the pipeline stages determined by the
[destination stage mask](#synchronization-pipeline-stages-masks) specified
by `dstStageMask`.
Within that, the second access scope only includes the second access scopes
defined by elements of the `pMemoryBarriers`,
`pBufferMemoryBarriers` and `pImageMemoryBarriers` arrays, which
each define a set of [memory barriers](#synchronization-memory-barriers).
If no memory barriers are specified, then the second access scope includes
no accesses.

If `dependencyFlags` includes `VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT`, then
any dependency between [framebuffer-space](#synchronization-framebuffer-regions) pipeline stages is
[framebuffer-local](#synchronization-framebuffer-regions) - otherwise it is
[framebuffer-global](#synchronization-framebuffer-regions).

`VkDependencyFlags` is a bitmask type for setting a mask of zero or more
[VkDependencyFlagBits](#VkDependencyFlagBits).

*Memory barriers* are used to explicitly control access to buffer and image
subresource ranges.
Memory barriers are used to [transfer ownership between queue families](#synchronization-queue-transfers),
[change image layouts](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions), and
define [availability and visibility operations](#synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible).
They explicitly define the [access types](#synchronization-access-types)
and buffer and image subresource ranges that are included in the
[access scopes](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) of a memory
dependency that is created by a synchronization command that includes them.

Global memory barriers apply to memory accesses involving all memory objects
that exist at the time of its execution.

The `VkMemoryBarrier2` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
typedef struct VkMemoryBarrier2 {
    VkStructureType          sType;
    const void*              pNext;

    VkAccessFlags2           srcAccessMask;
    VkPipelineStageFlags2    dstStageMask;
    VkAccessFlags2           dstAccessMask;
} VkMemoryBarrier2;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_synchronization2
typedef VkMemoryBarrier2 VkMemoryBarrier2KHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`srcStageMask` is a [VkPipelineStageFlags2](#VkPipelineStageFlags2) mask of pipeline
stages to be included in the [    first synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes).

* 
`srcAccessMask` is a [VkAccessFlags2](#VkAccessFlags2) mask of access flags to be

* 
`dstAccessMask` is a [VkAccessFlags2](#VkAccessFlags2) mask of access flags to be
included in the [second    access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes).

This structure defines a [memory dependency](#synchronization-dependencies-memory) affecting all device memory.

The first [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) and
[access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) described by
this structure include only operations and memory accesses specified by the
source stage mask and source access mask.

The second [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
and [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) described
by this structure include only operations and memory accesses specified by
destination stage mask and destination access mask.

Buffer memory barriers only apply to memory accesses involving a specific
buffer range.
That is, a memory dependency formed from a buffer memory barrier is
[scoped](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) to access via the
specified buffer range.
Buffer memory barriers **can** also be used to define a
[queue family ownership transfer](#synchronization-queue-transfers) for the
specified buffer range.

The `VkBufferMemoryBarrier2` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
typedef struct VkBufferMemoryBarrier2 {
    VkStructureType          sType;
    const void*              pNext;
    VkPipelineStageFlags2    srcStageMask;
    VkAccessFlags2           srcAccessMask;
    VkPipelineStageFlags2    dstStageMask;
    VkAccessFlags2           dstAccessMask;
    uint32_t                 srcQueueFamilyIndex;
    uint32_t                 dstQueueFamilyIndex;
    VkBuffer                 buffer;
    VkDeviceSize             offset;
    VkDeviceSize             size;
} VkBufferMemoryBarrier2;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_synchronization2
typedef VkBufferMemoryBarrier2 VkBufferMemoryBarrier2KHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`srcStageMask` is a [VkPipelineStageFlags2](#VkPipelineStageFlags2) mask of pipeline
stages to be included in the [    first synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes).

* 
`srcAccessMask` is a [VkAccessFlags2](#VkAccessFlags2) mask of access flags to be
included in the [first    access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes).

* 
`dstStageMask` is a [VkPipelineStageFlags2](#VkPipelineStageFlags2) mask of pipeline
stages to be included in the [    second synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes).

* 
`dstAccessMask` is a [VkAccessFlags2](#VkAccessFlags2) mask of access flags to be
included in the [second    access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes).

* 
`srcQueueFamilyIndex` is the source queue family for a
[queue family ownership transfer](#synchronization-queue-transfers).

* 
`dstQueueFamilyIndex` is the destination queue family for a
[queue family ownership transfer](#synchronization-queue-transfers).

* 
`buffer` is a handle to the buffer whose backing memory is affected
by the barrier.

* 
`offset` is an offset in bytes into the backing memory for
`buffer`; this is relative to the base offset as bound to the buffer
(see [vkBindBufferMemory](resources.html#vkBindBufferMemory)).

* 
`size` is a size in bytes of the affected area of backing memory for
`buffer`, or `VK_WHOLE_SIZE` to use the range from `offset`
to the end of the buffer.

This structure defines a [memory dependency](#synchronization-dependencies-memory) limited to a range of a buffer, and **can** define a
[queue family ownership transfer operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers) for that range.

The first [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) and
[access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) described by
this structure include only operations and memory accesses specified by the
source stage mask and the source access mask.

The second [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
and [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) described
by this structure include only operations and memory accesses specified by
the destination stage mask and the destination access mask.

Both [access scopes](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) are
limited to only memory accesses to `buffer` in the range defined by
`offset` and `size`.

If `buffer` was created with `VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE`, and
`srcQueueFamilyIndex` is not equal to `dstQueueFamilyIndex`, this
memory barrier defines a [queue family ownership transfer operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers).
When executed on a queue in the family identified by
`srcQueueFamilyIndex`, this barrier defines a
[queue family release operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers-release)
for the specified buffer range, and
if [VkDependencyInfoKHR](#VkDependencyInfoKHR)::`dependencyFlags` did not include
`VK_DEPENDENCY_QUEUE_FAMILY_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_USE_ALL_STAGES_BIT_KHR`,
the second synchronization scope does not apply to this operation.
When executed on a queue in the family identified by
`dstQueueFamilyIndex`, this barrier defines a
[queue family acquire operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers-acquire)
for the specified buffer range, and
if [VkDependencyInfoKHR](#VkDependencyInfoKHR)::`dependencyFlags` did not include
`VK_DEPENDENCY_QUEUE_FAMILY_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_USE_ALL_STAGES_BIT_KHR`,
the first synchronization scope does not apply to this operation.

A [queue family ownership transfer operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers) is also defined if the values are not equal, and either is one
of the special queue family values reserved for external memory ownership
transfers, as described in [Queue Family Ownership Transfer](#synchronization-queue-transfers).
A [queue family release operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers-release) is defined when `dstQueueFamilyIndex` is one of those
values, and a [queue family acquire operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers-acquire) is defined when `srcQueueFamilyIndex` is one of

The `VkBufferMemoryBarrier` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkBufferMemoryBarrier {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    const void*        pNext;
    VkAccessFlags      srcAccessMask;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`srcAccessMask` is a bitmask of [VkAccessFlagBits](#VkAccessFlagBits) specifying a
[source access mask](#synchronization-access-masks).

* 
`dstAccessMask` is a bitmask of [VkAccessFlagBits](#VkAccessFlagBits) specifying a
[destination access mask](#synchronization-access-masks).

* 
`srcQueueFamilyIndex` is the source queue family for a
[queue family ownership transfer](#synchronization-queue-transfers).

* 
`dstQueueFamilyIndex` is the destination queue family for a
[queue family ownership transfer](#synchronization-queue-transfers).

* 
`buffer` is a handle to the buffer whose backing memory is affected
by the barrier.

* 
`offset` is an offset in bytes into the backing memory for
`buffer`; this is relative to the base offset as bound to the buffer
(see [vkBindBufferMemory](resources.html#vkBindBufferMemory)).

* 
`size` is a size in bytes of the affected area of backing memory for
`buffer`, or `VK_WHOLE_SIZE` to use the range from `offset`
to the end of the buffer.

The first [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) is
limited to access to memory through the specified buffer range, via access
types in the [source access mask](#synchronization-access-masks) specified
by
`srcAccessMask` and, if a [VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR](#VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR) is passed
in `pNext`, `srcAccessMask3`.
If the source access mask includes `VK_ACCESS_HOST_WRITE_BIT`, a
[memory domain operation](#synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible) is performed where available memory in the host domain is also
made available to the device domain.

The second [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) is
limited to access to memory through the specified buffer range, via access
types in the [destination access mask](#synchronization-access-masks)
specified by
`dstAccessMask` and, if a [VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR](#VkMemoryBarrierAccessFlags3KHR) is passed
in `pNext`, `dstAccessMask3`.
If the destination access mask includes `VK_ACCESS_HOST_WRITE_BIT` or
`VK_ACCESS_HOST_READ_BIT`, a
[memory domain operation](#synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible) is performed where available memory in the device domain is also
made available to the host domain.

|  | When `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT` is used, available memory in

host domain is automatically made visible to host domain, and any host write
is automatically made available to host domain. |

If `srcQueueFamilyIndex` is not equal to `dstQueueFamilyIndex`, and
`srcQueueFamilyIndex` is equal to the current queue family, then the
memory barrier defines a [queue family release operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers-release) for the specified buffer range, and
if `dependencyFlags` did not include
`VK_DEPENDENCY_QUEUE_FAMILY_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_USE_ALL_STAGES_BIT_KHR`,
the second synchronization scope of the calling command does not apply to
this operation.

If `dstQueueFamilyIndex` is not equal to `srcQueueFamilyIndex`, and
`dstQueueFamilyIndex` is equal to the current queue family, then the
memory barrier defines a [queue family acquire operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers-acquire) for the specified buffer range, and
if `dependencyFlags` did not include
`VK_DEPENDENCY_QUEUE_FAMILY_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_USE_ALL_STAGES_BIT_KHR`,
the first synchronization scope of the calling command does not apply to
this operation.

Image memory barriers only apply to memory accesses involving a specific
image subresource range.
That is, a memory dependency formed from an image memory barrier is
[scoped](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) to access via the
specified image subresource range.
Image memory barriers **can** also be used to define
[image layout transitions](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions) or a
[queue family ownership transfer](#synchronization-queue-transfers) for the
specified image subresource range.

The `VkImageMemoryBarrier2` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
typedef struct VkImageMemoryBarrier2 {
    VkStructureType            sType;
    const void*                pNext;

    VkImage                    image;

typedef VkImageMemoryBarrier2 VkImageMemoryBarrier2KHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`srcStageMask` is a [VkPipelineStageFlags2](#VkPipelineStageFlags2) mask of pipeline
stages to be included in the [    first synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes).

* 
`srcAccessMask` is a [VkAccessFlags2](#VkAccessFlags2) mask of access flags to be

* 
`dstStageMask` is a [VkPipelineStageFlags2](#VkPipelineStageFlags2) mask of pipeline

* 
`dstAccessMask` is a [VkAccessFlags2](#VkAccessFlags2) mask of access flags to be
included in the [second    access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes).

* 
`oldLayout` is the old layout in an
[image layout transition](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions).

* 
`newLayout` is the new layout in an
[image layout transition](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions).

* 
`srcQueueFamilyIndex` is the source queue family for a
[queue family ownership transfer](#synchronization-queue-transfers).

* 
`dstQueueFamilyIndex` is the destination queue family for a
[queue family ownership transfer](#synchronization-queue-transfers).

* 
`image` is a handle to the image affected by this barrier.

* 
`subresourceRange` describes the [image    subresource range](resources.html#resources-image-views) within `image` that is affected by this barrier.

This structure defines a [memory dependency](#synchronization-dependencies-memory) limited to an image subresource range, and **can** define a
[queue family ownership transfer operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers) and [image layout transition](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions) for that subresource range.

The first [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) and
[access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) described by
this structure include only operations and memory accesses specified by the
source stage mask and the source access mask.

The second [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
and [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) described
by this structure include only operations and memory accesses specified by
the destination stage mask and the destination access mask.

Both [access scopes](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) are
limited to only memory accesses to `image` in the subresource range
defined by `subresourceRange`.

If `image` was created with `VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE`, and
`srcQueueFamilyIndex` is not equal to `dstQueueFamilyIndex`, this
memory barrier defines a [queue family ownership transfer operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers).
When executed on a queue in the family identified by
`srcQueueFamilyIndex`, this barrier defines a
[queue family release operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers-release)
for the specified image subresource range, and
if [VkDependencyInfoKHR](#VkDependencyInfoKHR)::`dependencyFlags` did not include
`VK_DEPENDENCY_QUEUE_FAMILY_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_USE_ALL_STAGES_BIT_KHR`,
the second synchronization scope does not apply to this operation.
When executed on a queue in the family identified by
`dstQueueFamilyIndex`, this barrier defines a
[queue family acquire operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers-acquire)
for the specified image subresource range, and
if [VkDependencyInfoKHR](#VkDependencyInfoKHR)::`dependencyFlags` did not include
`VK_DEPENDENCY_QUEUE_FAMILY_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_USE_ALL_STAGES_BIT_KHR`,
the first synchronization scope does not apply to this operation.

A [queue family ownership transfer operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers) is also defined if the values are not equal, and either is one
of the special queue family values reserved for external memory ownership
transfers, as described in [Queue Family Ownership Transfer](#synchronization-queue-transfers).
A [queue family release operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers-release) is defined when `dstQueueFamilyIndex` is one of those
values, and a [queue family acquire operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers-acquire) is defined when `srcQueueFamilyIndex` is one of
those values.

If `oldLayout` is not equal to `newLayout`, then the memory barrier
defines an [image layout transition](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions) for the specified image subresource range.
If this memory barrier defines a [queue family ownership transfer operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers), the layout transition is only
executed once between the queues.

|  | When the old and new layout are equal, the layout values are ignored - data
| --- | --- |
is preserved no matter what values are specified, or what layout the image
is currently in. |

If `image` has a [multi-planar format](formats.html#formats-multiplanar) and the
image is *disjoint*, then including `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT` in the
`aspectMask` member of `subresourceRange` is equivalent to including
`VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_0_BIT`, `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_1_BIT`, and
(for three-plane formats only) `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_2_BIT`.

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`srcAccessMask` is a bitmask of [VkAccessFlagBits](#VkAccessFlagBits) specifying a

* 
`dstAccessMask` is a bitmask of [VkAccessFlagBits](#VkAccessFlagBits) specifying a
[destination access mask](#synchronization-access-masks).

* 
`oldLayout` is the old layout in an
[image layout transition](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions).

* 
`newLayout` is the new layout in an
[image layout transition](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions).

* 
`srcQueueFamilyIndex` is the source queue family for a
[queue family ownership transfer](#synchronization-queue-transfers).

* 
`dstQueueFamilyIndex` is the destination queue family for a
[queue family ownership transfer](#synchronization-queue-transfers).

* 
`image` is a handle to the image affected by this barrier.

* 
`subresourceRange` describes the [image    subresource range](resources.html#resources-image-views) within `image` that is affected by this barrier.

The first [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) is
limited to access to memory through the specified image subresource range,
via access types in the [source access mask](#synchronization-access-masks)
specified by `srcAccessMask`.
If `srcAccessMask` includes `VK_ACCESS_HOST_WRITE_BIT`, memory
writes performed by that access type are also made visible, as that access
type is not performed through a resource.

The second [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) is
limited to access to memory through the specified image subresource range,
via access types in the [destination access mask](#synchronization-access-masks) specified by `dstAccessMask`.
If `dstAccessMask` includes `VK_ACCESS_HOST_WRITE_BIT` or
`VK_ACCESS_HOST_READ_BIT`, available memory writes are also made visible
to accesses of those types, as those access types are not performed through
a resource.

If `srcQueueFamilyIndex` is not equal to `dstQueueFamilyIndex`, and
`srcQueueFamilyIndex` is equal to the current queue family, then the
memory barrier defines a [queue family release operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers-release) for the specified image subresource range, and
if `dependencyFlags` did not include
`VK_DEPENDENCY_QUEUE_FAMILY_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_USE_ALL_STAGES_BIT_KHR`,
the second synchronization scope of the calling command does not apply to
this operation.

If `dstQueueFamilyIndex` is not equal to `srcQueueFamilyIndex`, and
`dstQueueFamilyIndex` is equal to the current queue family, then the
memory barrier defines a [queue family acquire operation](#synchronization-queue-transfers-acquire) for the specified image subresource range, and
if `dependencyFlags` did not include
`VK_DEPENDENCY_QUEUE_FAMILY_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_USE_ALL_STAGES_BIT_KHR`,
the first synchronization scope of the calling command does not apply to
this operation.

If the [`synchronization2`](features.html#features-synchronization2) feature is not
enabled or `oldLayout` is not equal to `newLayout`,
`oldLayout` and `newLayout` define an
[image layout transition](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions) for
the specified image subresource range.

|  | If the [`synchronization2`](features.html#features-synchronization2) feature is
| --- | --- |
enabled, when the old and new layout are equal, the layout values are
ignored - data is preserved no matter what values are specified, or what
layout the image is currently in. |

If `image` has a [multi-planar format](formats.html#formats-multiplanar) and the
image is *disjoint*, then including `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT` in the
`aspectMask` member of `subresourceRange` is equivalent to including
`VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_0_BIT`, `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_1_BIT`, and
(for three-plane formats only) `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_2_BIT`.

To facilitate usage of images whose memory is initialized on the host,
Vulkan allows image layout transitions to be performed by the host as well,
albeit supporting limited layouts.

To perform an image layout transition on the host, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4
VkResult vkTransitionImageLayout(
    VkDevice                                    device,

    const VkHostImageLayoutTransitionInfo*      pTransitions);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_EXT_host_image_copy
VkResult vkTransitionImageLayoutEXT(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    uint32_t                                    transitionCount,
    const VkHostImageLayoutTransitionInfo*      pTransitions);

* 
`device` is the device which owns `pTransitions`[i].`image`.

* 
`transitionCount` is the number of image layout transitions to
perform.

* 
`pTransitions` is a pointer to an array of
[VkHostImageLayoutTransitionInfo](#VkHostImageLayoutTransitionInfo) structures specifying the image
and [subresource ranges](resources.html#resources-image-views) within them to
transition.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`image` is a handle to the image affected by this layout transition.

* 
`oldLayout` is the old layout in an
[image layout transition](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions).

* 
`newLayout` is the new layout in an
[image layout transition](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions).

* 
`subresourceRange` describes the [image    subresource range](resources.html#resources-image-views) within `image` that is affected by this layout
transition.

`vkTransitionImageLayout` does not check whether the device memory
associated with an image is currently in use before performing the layout
transition.
The application **must** guarantee that any previously submitted command that
reads from or writes to this subresource has completed before the host
performs the layout transition.
The memory of `image` is accessed by the host as if [coherent](memory.html#memory-coherent).

|  | Image layout transitions performed on the host do not require queue family

ownership transfers as the physical layout of the image will not vary
between queue families for the layouts supported by this function. |

Resources created with a [VkSharingMode](resources.html#VkSharingMode) of
`VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE` **must** have their ownership explicitly
transferred from one queue family to another in order to access their
content in a well-defined manner on a queue in a different queue family.

The special queue family index `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED` indicates that
a queue family parameter or member is ignored.

#define VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED           (~0U)

Resources shared with external APIs or instances using external memory **must**
also explicitly manage ownership transfers between local and external queues
(or equivalent constructs in external APIs) regardless of the
[VkSharingMode](resources.html#VkSharingMode) specified when creating them.

The special queue family index `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL` represents any
queue external to the resource’s current Vulkan instance, as long as the
queue uses the same underlying
device group or
physical device, and the same driver version as the resource’s
[VkDevice](devsandqueues.html#VkDevice), as indicated by
[VkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties](devsandqueues.html#VkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties)::`deviceUUID` and
[VkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties](devsandqueues.html#VkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties)::`driverUUID`.

#define VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL          (~1U)

or the equivalent

#define VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR      VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL

The special queue family index `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT` represents
any queue external to the resource’s current Vulkan instance, regardless of
the queue’s underlying physical device or driver version.
This includes, for example, queues for fixed-function image processing
devices, media codec devices, and display devices, as well as all queues
that use the same underlying
device group or
physical device, and the same driver version as the resource’s
[VkDevice](devsandqueues.html#VkDevice).

#define VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT       (~2U)

If memory dependencies are correctly expressed between uses of such a
resource between two queues in different families, but no ownership transfer
is defined, the contents of that resource are **undefined** for any read
accesses performed by the second queue family.

|  | If an application does not need the contents of a resource to remain valid
| --- | --- |
when transferring from one queue family to another, then the ownership
transfer **should** be skipped. |

|  | Applications should expect transfers to/from
| --- | --- |
`VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT` to be more expensive than transfers
to/from `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR`. |

A queue family ownership transfer consists of two distinct parts:

Release exclusive ownership from the source queue family

Acquire exclusive ownership for the destination queue family

An application **must** ensure that these operations occur in the correct order
by defining an execution dependency between them, e.g. using a semaphore.

 A *release operation* is used to
release exclusive ownership of a range of a buffer or image subresource
range.
A release operation is defined by executing a
[buffer memory barrier](#synchronization-buffer-memory-barriers) (for a
buffer range) or an [image memory barrier](#synchronization-image-memory-barriers) (for an image subresource range) using a pipeline barrier command,
on a queue from the source queue family.
The `srcQueueFamilyIndex` parameter of the barrier **must** be the source
queue family index, and the `dstQueueFamilyIndex` parameter to the
destination queue family index.
The destination access mask is ignored for such a barrier, such that no
visibility operation is executed - the value of this mask does not affect
the validity of the barrier.
The release operation happens-after the availability operation.
If `dependencyFlags` does not include
`VK_DEPENDENCY_QUEUE_FAMILY_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_USE_ALL_STAGES_BIT_KHR`,
`dstStageMask` is also ignored for such a barrier as defined by
[buffer memory ownership transfer](#buffer-memory-barrier-ownership-transfer) and [image memory ownership transfer](#image-memory-barrier-ownership-transfer).

 An *acquire operation* is used
to acquire exclusive ownership of a range of a buffer or image subresource
range.
An acquire operation is defined by executing a
[buffer memory barrier](#synchronization-buffer-memory-barriers) (for a
buffer range) or an [image memory barrier](#synchronization-image-memory-barriers) (for an image subresource range) using a pipeline barrier command,
on a queue from the destination queue family.
The buffer range or image subresource range specified in an acquire
operation **must** match exactly that of a previous release operation.
The `srcQueueFamilyIndex` parameter of the barrier **must** be the source
queue family index, and the `dstQueueFamilyIndex` parameter to the
destination queue family index.
The source access mask is ignored for such a barrier, such that no
availability operation is executed - the value of this mask does not affect
the validity of the barrier.
The acquire operation happens-before the visibility operation.
If `dependencyFlags` does not include
`VK_DEPENDENCY_QUEUE_FAMILY_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_USE_ALL_STAGES_BIT_KHR`,
`srcStageMask` is also ignored for such a barrier as defined by
[buffer memory ownership transfer](#buffer-memory-barrier-ownership-transfer) and [image memory ownership transfer](#image-memory-barrier-ownership-transfer).

|  | Whilst it is not invalid to provide destination or source access masks for
| --- | --- |
memory barriers used for release or acquire operations, respectively, they
have no practical effect.
Access after a release operation has **undefined** results, and so visibility
for those accesses has no practical effect.
Similarly, write access before an acquire operation will produce **undefined**
results for future access, so availability of those writes has no practical
use.
In an earlier version of the specification, these were required to match on
both sides - but this was subsequently relaxed.
These masks **should** be set to 0. |

|  | To ensure that an acquire and release operation are valid, the release
| --- | --- |
operation must happen-before the acquire operation.
Often, semaphores are used for this directly, with the semaphore signaling
after a release and then waiting before an acquire.
Prior to the introduction of
`VK_DEPENDENCY_QUEUE_FAMILY_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_USE_ALL_STAGES_BIT_KHR`,
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT` is the only valid stage to wait on
or wait for these operations, as the acquire and release operations do not
occur in a defined stage.
When
`VK_DEPENDENCY_QUEUE_FAMILY_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_USE_ALL_STAGES_BIT_KHR`
is specified however, these can be synchronized with the stages which would
otherwise be ignored, as these stages now synchronize the acquire and
release operations, providing a way to avoid full pipeline stalls. |

If the transfer is via an image memory barrier, and an
[image layout transition](#synchronization-image-layout-transitions) is
desired, then the values of `oldLayout` and `newLayout` in the
*release operation*'s memory barrier **must** be equal to values of
`oldLayout` and `newLayout` in the *acquire operation*'s memory
barrier.
Although the image layout transition is submitted twice, it will only be
executed once.
A layout transition specified in this way happens-after the *release
operation* and happens-before the *acquire operation*.

If the values of `srcQueueFamilyIndex` and `dstQueueFamilyIndex` are
equal, no ownership transfer is performed, and the barrier operates as if
they were both set to `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED`.

Queue family ownership transfers **may** perform read and write accesses on all
memory bound to the image subresource or buffer range, so applications **must**
ensure that all memory writes have been made
[available](#synchronization-dependencies-available-and-visible) before a
queue family ownership transfer is executed.
Available memory is automatically made visible to queue family release and
acquire operations, and writes performed by those operations are
automatically made available.

Once a queue family has acquired ownership of a buffer range or image
subresource range of a `VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE` resource, its
contents are **undefined** to other queue families unless ownership is
transferred.
The contents of any portion of another resource which aliases memory that is
bound to the transferred buffer or image subresource range are **undefined**
after a release or acquire operation.

|  | Because [events](#synchronization-events) **cannot** be used directly for
| --- | --- |
inter-queue synchronization, and because [vkCmdSetEvent](#vkCmdSetEvent) does not have
the queue family index or memory barrier parameters needed by a *release
operation*, the release and acquire operations of a queue family ownership
transfer **can** only be performed using [vkCmdPipelineBarrier](#vkCmdPipelineBarrier). |

An *acquire operation* **may** have a performance penalty when acquiring
ownership of a subresource range from one of the special queue families
reserved for external memory ownership transfers described above.
The application **can** reduce the performance penalty in some cases by adding
a [VkExternalMemoryAcquireUnmodifiedEXT](#VkExternalMemoryAcquireUnmodifiedEXT) structure to the `pNext`
chain of the *acquire operation*'s memory barrier structure.

The `VkExternalMemoryAcquireUnmodifiedEXT` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_external_memory_acquire_unmodified
typedef struct VkExternalMemoryAcquireUnmodifiedEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    const void*        pNext;
    VkBool32           acquireUnmodifiedMemory;
} VkExternalMemoryAcquireUnmodifiedEXT;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`acquireUnmodifiedMemory` specifies, if `VK_TRUE`, that no range
of [VkDeviceMemory](memory.html#VkDeviceMemory) bound to the resource of the memory barrier’s
subresource range was modified at any time since the resource’s most
recent release of ownership to the queue family specified by the memory
barrier’s `srcQueueFamilyIndex`.
If `VK_FALSE`, it specifies nothing.

If the application releases ownership of the subresource range to one of the
special queue families reserved for external memory ownership transfers with
a memory barrier structure, and later re-acquires ownership from the same
queue family with a memory barrier structure, and if no range of
[VkDeviceMemory](memory.html#VkDeviceMemory) bound to the resource was modified at any time between
the *release operation* and the *acquire operation*, then the application
**should** add a [VkExternalMemoryAcquireUnmodifiedEXT](#VkExternalMemoryAcquireUnmodifiedEXT) structure to the
`pNext` chain of the *acquire operation*'s memory barrier structure
because this **may** reduce the performance penalty.

This structure is ignored if `acquireUnmodifiedMemory` is
`VK_FALSE`.
In particular, `VK_FALSE` does *not* specify that memory was modified.

This structure is ignored if the memory barrier’s `srcQueueFamilyIndex`
is not a special queue family reserved for external memory ownership
transfers.

|  | The method by which the application determines whether memory was modified
| --- | --- |
between the *release operation* and *acquire operation* is outside the scope
of Vulkan.

For any Vulkan operation that accesses a resource, the application **must** not
assume the implementation accesses the resource’s memory as read-only, even
for *apparently* read-only operations such as transfer commands and shader
reads.

The validity of
[VkExternalMemoryAcquireUnmodifiedEXT](#VkExternalMemoryAcquireUnmodifiedEXT)::`acquireUnmodifiedMemory` is
independent of memory ranges outside the ranges of [VkDeviceMemory](memory.html#VkDeviceMemory)
bound to the resource.
In particular, it is independent of any implementation-private memory
associated with the resource. |

When batches of command buffers are submitted to a queue via a
[queue submission command](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission), it defines a memory
dependency with prior host operations, and execution of command buffers
submitted to the queue.

The first [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes execution of [vkQueueSubmit](cmdbuffers.html#vkQueueSubmit) on the host and anything that
happened-before it, as defined by the host memory model.

|  | Some systems allow writes that do not directly integrate with the host
| --- | --- |
memory model; these have to be synchronized by the application manually.
One example of this is non-temporal store instructions on x86; to ensure
these happen-before submission, applications should call `_mm_sfence()`. |

The second [synchronization scope](#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes all commands submitted in the same [queue submission](devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission), and all commands that occur later in
[submission order](#synchronization-submission-order).

The first [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes)
includes all host writes to mappable device memory that are available to the
host memory domain.

The second [access scope](#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes)
includes all memory access performed by the device.

If a logical device includes more than one physical device, then fences,
semaphores, and events all still have a single instance of the signaled
state.

A fence becomes signaled when all physical devices complete the necessary
queue operations.

Semaphore wait and signal operations all include a device index that is the
sole physical device that performs the operation.
These indices are provided in the [VkDeviceGroupSubmitInfo](cmdbuffers.html#VkDeviceGroupSubmitInfo)
and [VkDeviceGroupBindSparseInfo](sparsemem.html#VkDeviceGroupBindSparseInfo)
structures.
Semaphores are not exclusively owned by any physical device.
For example, a semaphore can be signaled by one physical device and then
waited on by a different physical device.

An event **can** only be waited on by the same physical device that signaled it
(or the host).

In order to be able to correlate the time a particular operation took place
at on timelines of different time domains (e.g. a device operation vs. a
host operation), Vulkan allows querying calibrated timestamps from multiple
time domains.

To query calibrated timestamps from a set of time domains, call:

// Provided by VK_KHR_calibrated_timestamps
VkResult vkGetCalibratedTimestampsKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    uint32_t                                    timestampCount,
    const VkCalibratedTimestampInfoKHR*         pTimestampInfos,
    uint64_t*                                   pTimestamps,
    uint64_t*                                   pMaxDeviation);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_EXT_calibrated_timestamps
VkResult vkGetCalibratedTimestampsEXT(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    uint32_t                                    timestampCount,
    const VkCalibratedTimestampInfoKHR*         pTimestampInfos,
    uint64_t*                                   pTimestamps,
    uint64_t*                                   pMaxDeviation);

* 
`device` is the logical device used to perform the query.

* 
`timestampCount` is the number of timestamps to query.

* 
`pTimestampInfos` is a pointer to an array of `timestampCount`
[VkCalibratedTimestampInfoKHR](#VkCalibratedTimestampInfoKHR) structures, describing the time
domains the calibrated timestamps should be captured from.

* 
`pTimestamps` is a pointer to an array of `timestampCount`
64-bit unsigned integer values in which the requested calibrated
timestamp values are returned.

* 
`pMaxDeviation` is a pointer to a 64-bit unsigned integer value in
which the strictly positive maximum deviation, in nanoseconds, of the
calibrated timestamp values is returned.

|  | The maximum deviation **may** vary between calls to
| --- | --- |
`vkGetCalibratedTimestampsKHR` even for the same set of time domains due
to implementation and platform specific reasons.
It is the application’s responsibility to assess whether the returned
maximum deviation makes the timestamp values suitable for any particular
purpose and **can** choose to re-issue the timestamp calibration call pursuing
a lower deviation value. |

Calibrated timestamp values **can** be extrapolated to estimate future
coinciding timestamp values, however, depending on the nature of the time
domains and other properties of the platform extrapolating values over a
sufficiently long period of time **may** no longer be accurate enough to fit
any particular purpose, so applications are expected to re-calibrate the
timestamps on a regular basis.

The `VkCalibratedTimestampInfoKHR` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_calibrated_timestamps
typedef struct VkCalibratedTimestampInfoKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    const void*        pNext;
    VkTimeDomainKHR    timeDomain;
} VkCalibratedTimestampInfoKHR;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_EXT_calibrated_timestamps
typedef VkCalibratedTimestampInfoKHR VkCalibratedTimestampInfoEXT;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`timeDomain` is a [VkTimeDomainKHR](#VkTimeDomainKHR) value specifying the time
domain from which the calibrated timestamp value should be returned.

The set of supported time domains consists of:

// Provided by VK_KHR_calibrated_timestamps
typedef enum VkTimeDomainKHR {
    VK_TIME_DOMAIN_DEVICE_KHR = 0,
    VK_TIME_DOMAIN_CLOCK_MONOTONIC_KHR = 1,

* 
`VK_TIME_DOMAIN_DEVICE_KHR` specifies the device time domain.
Timestamp values in this time domain use the same units and are
comparable with device timestamp values captured using
[vkCmdWriteTimestamp](queries.html#vkCmdWriteTimestamp)
or [vkCmdWriteTimestamp2](queries.html#vkCmdWriteTimestamp2)
and are defined to be incrementing according to the
[`timestampPeriod`](limits.html#limits-timestampPeriod) of the device.

* 
`VK_TIME_DOMAIN_CLOCK_MONOTONIC_KHR` specifies the CLOCK_MONOTONIC
time domain available on POSIX platforms.
Timestamp values in this time domain are in units of nanoseconds and are
comparable with platform timestamp values captured using the POSIX
clock_gettime API as computed by this example:

|  | An implementation supporting
| --- | --- |
`[VK_KHR_calibrated_timestamps](../appendices/extensions.html#VK_KHR_calibrated_timestamps)`
or
`[VK_EXT_calibrated_timestamps](../appendices/extensions.html#VK_EXT_calibrated_timestamps)`
will use the same time domain for all its [VkQueue](devsandqueues.html#VkQueue) so that timestamp
values reported for `VK_TIME_DOMAIN_DEVICE_KHR` can be matched to any
timestamp captured through [vkCmdWriteTimestamp](queries.html#vkCmdWriteTimestamp)
or [vkCmdWriteTimestamp2](queries.html#vkCmdWriteTimestamp2)

* 
`VK_TIME_DOMAIN_CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW_KHR` specifies the
CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW time domain available on POSIX platforms.
Timestamp values in this time domain are in units of nanoseconds and are
comparable with platform timestamp values captured using the POSIX
clock_gettime API as computed by this example:

struct timespec tv;
clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW, &tv);
return tv.tv_nsec + tv.tv_sec*1000000000ull;

* 
`VK_TIME_DOMAIN_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_KHR` specifies the
performance counter (QPC) time domain available on Windows.
Timestamp values in this time domain are in the same units as those
provided by the Windows QueryPerformanceCounter API and are comparable
with platform timestamp values captured using that API as computed by
this example:

LARGE_INTEGER counter;
QueryPerformanceCounter(&counter);
return counter.QuadPart;
