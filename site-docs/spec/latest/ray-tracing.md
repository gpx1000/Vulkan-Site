Ray tracing uses a separate rendering pipeline from both the graphics and
compute pipelines (see [Ray Tracing Pipeline](pipelines.html#pipelines-ray-tracing)).

Interaction between the different shader stages in the ray tracing pipeline

Within the ray tracing pipeline, a [pipeline trace ray](../appendices/glossary.html#glossary-pipeline-trace-ray) instruction **can** be called to perform a [ray traversal](raytraversal.html#ray-traversal) that invokes the various ray tracing shader stages during its
execution.
The relationship between the ray tracing pipeline object and the geometries
present in the acceleration structure traversed is passed into the ray
tracing command in a [VkBuffer](resources.html#VkBuffer) object known as a *shader binding
table*.
`OpExecuteCallableKHR` can also be used in ray tracing pipelines to
invoke a [callable shader](shaders.html#shaders-callable).

During execution, control alternates between scheduling and other
operations.
The scheduling functionality is implementation-specific and is responsible
for workload execution.
The shader stages are programmable.
[*Traversal*](raytraversal.html#ray-traversal), which refers to the process of traversing
acceleration structures to find potential intersections of rays with
geometry, is fixed function.

The programmable portions of the pipeline are exposed in a single-ray
programming model, with each invocation handling one ray at a time.
Memory operations **can** be synchronized using standard memory barriers.
The `Workgroup` scope and variables with a storage class of
`Workgroup` **must** not be used in the ray tracing pipeline.

A *shader call* is an instruction which **may** cause execution to continue
elsewhere by creating one or more invocations that execute a different
shader stage.

The following table lists all shader call instructions and which stages each
one **can** directly call.

| Instruction | Intersection | Any-Hit | Closest Hit | Miss | Callable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OpTraceRayKHR` | X | X | X | X |  |
| `OpTraceRayMotionNV` | X | X | X | X |  |
| `OpReportIntersectionKHR` |  | X |  |  |  |
| `OpExecuteCallableKHR` |  |  |  |  | X |
| `OpHitObjectTraceRayNV` | X | X |  |  |  |
| `OpHitObjectTraceRayMotionNV` | X | X |  |  |  |
| `OpHitObjectExecuteShaderNV` |  |  | X | X |  |
| `OpHitObjectExecuteShaderEXT` |  |  | X | X |  |
| `OpHitObjectTraceRayEXT` | X | X |  |  |  |
| `OpHitObjectReorderExecuteShaderEXT` |  |  | X | X |  |
| `OpHitObjectTraceReorderExecuteEXT` | X | X | X | X |  |
| `OpHitObjectTraceRayMotionEXT` | X | X |  |  |  |
| `OpHitObjectTraceMotionReorderExecuteEXT` | X | X | X | X |  |

The invocations created by shader call instructions are grouped into
subgroups by the implementation.
Those subgroups **may** be unrelated to the subgroup of the parent invocation.

*Pipeline trace ray instructions* **can** be used recursively; invoked shaders
**can** themselves execute pipeline trace ray instructions, to a maximum depth
defined by the
[`maxRecursionDepth`](limits.html#limits-maxRecursionDepth) or
[`maxRayRecursionDepth`](limits.html#limits-maxRayRecursionDepth) limit.

Shaders directly invoked from the API always have a recursion depth of 0;
each shader executed by a pipeline trace ray instruction has a recursion
depth one higher than the recursion depth of the shader which invoked it.
Applications **must** not invoke a shader with a recursion depth greater than
the value of
`maxRecursionDepth` or
`maxPipelineRayRecursionDepth` specified in the pipeline.

There is no explicit recursion limit for other shader call instructions
which may recurse (e.g. `OpExecuteCallableKHR`) but there is an upper
bound determined by the [stack size](#ray-tracing-pipeline-stack).

An *invocation repack instruction* is a ray tracing instruction where the
implementation **may** change the set of invocations that are executing.
When a repack instruction is encountered, the invocation is suspended and a
new invocation begins and executes the instruction.
After executing the repack instruction (which **may** result in other ray
tracing shader stages executing) the new invocation ends and the original
invocation is resumed, but it **may** be resumed in a different subgroup or at
a different `SubgroupLocalInvocationId` within the same subgroup.
When a subset of invocations in a subgroup execute the invocation repack
instruction, those that do not execute it remain in the same subgroup at the
same `SubgroupLocalInvocationId`.

The `OpTraceRayKHR`,
`OpTraceRayMotionNV`,
`OpReorderThreadWithHintNV`, `OpReorderThreadWithHitObjectNV`,
`OpReorderThreadWithHintEXT`, `OpReorderThreadWithHitObjectEXT`,
`OpHitObjectTraceRayEXT`, `OpHitObjectReorderExecuteShaderEXT`,
`OpHitObjectTraceReorderExecuteEXT`,
`OpHitObjectTraceRayMotionEXT`,
`OpHitObjectTraceMotionReorderExecuteEXT`,
`OpReportIntersectionKHR`, and `OpExecuteCallableKHR` instructions are
invocation repack instructions.

The invocations that are executing before a shader call instruction, after
the instruction, or are created by the instruction, are
[shader-call-related](../appendices/memorymodel.html#shader-call-related).

If the implementation changes the composition of subgroups, the values of
`SubgroupSize`, `SubgroupLocalInvocationId`,
`SMIDNV`, `WarpIDNV`,
and builtin variables that are derived from them (`SubgroupEqMask`,
`SubgroupGeMask`, `SubgroupGtMask`, `SubgroupLeMask`,
`SubgroupLtMask`) **must** be changed accordingly by the invocation repack
instruction.
The application **must** use [`Volatile` semantics](../appendices/spirvenv.html#builtin-volatile-semantics) on these `BuiltIn` variables when used in the ray generation,
closest hit, miss, intersection, and callable shaders.
Similarly, the application **must** use `Volatile` semantics on any
`RayTmaxKHR` decorated `Builtin` used in an intersection shader.

|  | [Subgroup operations](shaders.html#shaders-group-operations) are permitted in the
| --- | --- |
programmable ray tracing shader stages.
However, shader call instructions place a bound on where results of subgroup
instructions or subgroup-scoped instructions that execute the dynamic
instance of that instruction are potentially valid.
For example, care **must** be taken when using the result of a ballot operation
that was computed before an invocation repack instruction, after that repack
instruction.
The ballot **may** be incorrect as the set of invocations could have changed.

While the `SubgroupSize` built-in is required to be declared
`Volatile`, its value will never change unless
`VK_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_ALLOW_VARYING_SUBGROUP_SIZE_BIT` is set
on pipeline creation, as without that bit set, its value is required to
match that of [VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupProperties](limits.html#VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupProperties)::`subgroupSize`.

For clock operations, the value of a `Subgroup` scoped
`OpReadClockKHR` read before the dynamic instance of a repack instruction
**should** not be compared to the result of that clock instruction after the
repack instruction. |

When a ray tracing shader executes a dynamic instance of an invocation
repack instruction which results in another ray tracing shader being
invoked, their instructions are related by
[shader-call-order](../appendices/memorymodel.html#shader-call-order).

For ray tracing invocations that are
[shader-call-related](../appendices/memorymodel.html#shader-call-related):

* 
[memory operations](../appendices/memorymodel.html#memory-model-memory-operation) on
    `StorageBuffer`, `Image`, and `ShaderRecordBufferKHR` storage
    classes **can** be synchronized using the
`ShaderCallKHR`
    scope.

* 
the `CallableDataKHR`, `IncomingCallableDataKHR`,
`RayPayloadKHR`, `HitAttributeKHR`, and `IncomingRayPayloadKHR`
storage classes are [system-synchronized](../appendices/memorymodel.html#memory-model-shader-io) and
no application availability and visibility operations are required.

* 
memory operations within a single invocation before and after the shader
call instruction are ordered by
[program-order](../appendices/memorymodel.html#memory-model-program-order) and do not require explicit
synchronization.

*Ray tracing commands* provoke work in the ray tracing pipeline.
Ray tracing commands are recorded into a command buffer and when executed by
a queue will produce work that executes according to the bound ray tracing
pipeline.
A ray tracing pipeline **must** be bound to a command buffer before any ray
tracing commands are recorded in that command buffer.

To dispatch ray tracing use:

// Provided by VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline
void vkCmdTraceRaysKHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR*      pRaygenShaderBindingTable,
    const VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR*      pMissShaderBindingTable,
    const VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR*      pHitShaderBindingTable,
    const VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR*      pCallableShaderBindingTable,
    uint32_t                                    width,
    uint32_t                                    height,
    uint32_t                                    depth);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be
recorded.

* 
`pRaygenShaderBindingTable` is a
[VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR](resources.html#VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR) that holds the shader binding
table data for the ray generation shader stage.

* 
`pMissShaderBindingTable` is a [VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR](resources.html#VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR)
that holds the shader binding table data for the miss shader stage.

* 
`pHitShaderBindingTable` is a [VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR](resources.html#VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR)
that holds the shader binding table data for the hit shader stage.

* 
`pCallableShaderBindingTable` is a
[VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR](resources.html#VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR) that holds the shader binding
table data for the callable shader stage.

* 
`width` is the width of the ray trace query dimensions.

* 
`height` is height of the ray trace query dimensions.

* 
`depth` is depth of the ray trace query dimensions.

When the command is executed, a ray generation group of `width`
× `height` × `depth` rays is assembled.

Conditional Rendering

vkCmdTraceRaysIndirectKHR is not affected by [conditional rendering](drawing.html#drawing-conditional-rendering)

The `VkTraceRaysIndirectCommandKHR` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline
typedef struct VkTraceRaysIndirectCommandKHR {
    uint32_t    width;
    uint32_t    height;
    uint32_t    depth;
} VkTraceRaysIndirectCommandKHR;

* 
`width` is the width of the ray trace query dimensions.

* 
`height` is height of the ray trace query dimensions.

* 
`depth` is depth of the ray trace query dimensions.

The members of `VkTraceRaysIndirectCommandKHR` have the same meaning as
the similarly named parameters of [vkCmdTraceRaysKHR](#vkCmdTraceRaysKHR).

Valid Usage

* 
[](#VUID-VkTraceRaysIndirectCommandKHR-width-03638) VUID-VkTraceRaysIndirectCommandKHR-width-03638

× `VkPhysicalDeviceLimits`::`maxComputeWorkGroupSize`[2]

* 
[](#VUID-VkTraceRaysIndirectCommandKHR-width-03641) VUID-VkTraceRaysIndirectCommandKHR-width-03641

`width` × `height` × `depth` **must** be less
than or equal to
`VkPhysicalDeviceRayTracingPipelinePropertiesKHR`::`maxRayDispatchInvocationCount`

To dispatch ray tracing, with some parameters sourced on the device, use:

// Provided by VK_KHR_ray_tracing_maintenance1 with VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline
void vkCmdTraceRaysIndirect2KHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkDeviceAddress                             indirectDeviceAddress);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be
recorded.

* 
`indirectDeviceAddress` is a buffer device address which is a
pointer to a [VkTraceRaysIndirectCommand2KHR](#VkTraceRaysIndirectCommand2KHR) structure containing
the trace ray parameters.

`vkCmdTraceRaysIndirect2KHR` behaves similarly to
[vkCmdTraceRaysIndirectKHR](#vkCmdTraceRaysIndirectKHR) except that shader binding table parameters
as well as dispatch dimensions are read by the device from
`indirectDeviceAddress` during execution.

Conditional Rendering

vkCmdTraceRaysNV is not affected by [conditional rendering](drawing.html#drawing-conditional-rendering)

A *shader binding table* is a resource which establishes the relationship
between the ray tracing pipeline and the acceleration structures that were
built for the ray tracing pipeline.
It indicates the shaders that operate on each geometry in an acceleration
structure.
In addition, it contains the resources accessed by each shader, including
indices of textures, buffer device addresses, and constants.
The application allocates and manages *shader binding tables* as
[VkBuffer](resources.html#VkBuffer) objects.

Each entry in the shader binding table consists of
`shaderGroupHandleSize` bytes of data, either as queried by
[vkGetRayTracingShaderGroupHandlesKHR](pipelines.html#vkGetRayTracingShaderGroupHandlesKHR) to refer to those specified
shaders, or all zeros to refer to a zero shader group.
A zero shader group behaves as though it is a shader group consisting
entirely of `VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR`.
The remainder of the data specified by the stride is application-visible
data that can be referenced by a `ShaderRecordBufferKHR` block in the
shader.

The shader binding tables to use in a ray tracing pipeline are passed to the
[vkCmdTraceRaysNV](#vkCmdTraceRaysNV)
,
[vkCmdTraceRaysKHR](#vkCmdTraceRaysKHR), or [vkCmdTraceRaysIndirectKHR](#vkCmdTraceRaysIndirectKHR)
commands.
Shader binding tables are read-only in shaders that are executing on the ray
tracing pipeline.

Shader variables identified with the `ShaderRecordBufferKHR` storage
class are used to access the provided shader binding table.
Such variables **must** be:

* 
typed as `OpTypeStruct`, or an array of this type,

* 
identified with a `Block` decoration, and

* 
laid out explicitly using the `Offset`, `ArrayStride`, and
`MatrixStride` decorations as specified in
[Offset and Stride Assignment](interfaces.html#interfaces-resources-layout).

The `Offset` decoration for any member of a `Block`-decorated variable
in the `ShaderRecordBufferKHR` storage class **must** not cause the space
required for that variable to extend outside the range [0,
`maxStorageBufferRange`).

Accesses to the shader binding table from ray tracing pipelines **must** be
[synchronized](synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies) with the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_RAY_TRACING_SHADER_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages) and an
[access type](synchronization.html#synchronization-access-types) of
`VK_ACCESS_SHADER_READ_BIT`.

|  | Because different shader record buffers can be associated with the same
| --- | --- |
shader, a shader variable with `ShaderRecordBufferKHR` storage class will
not be dynamically uniform if different invocations of the same shader can
reference different data in the shader record buffer, such as if the same
shader occurs twice in the shader binding table with a different shader
record buffer.
In this case, indexing resources based on values in the
`ShaderRecordBufferKHR` storage class, the index should be decorated as
`NonUniform`. |

In order to execute the correct shaders and access the correct resources
during a ray tracing dispatch, the implementation **must** be able to locate
shader binding table entries at various stages of execution.
This is accomplished by defining a set of indexing rules that compute shader
binding table record positions relative to the buffer’s base address in
memory.
The application **must** organize the contents of the shader binding table’s
memory in a way that application of the indexing rules will lead to correct
records.

Only one ray generation shader is executed per ray tracing dispatch.

For [vkCmdTraceRaysKHR](#vkCmdTraceRaysKHR), the location of the ray generation shader is
specified by the `pRaygenShaderBindingTable->deviceAddress` parameter — there is no indexing.
All data accessed **must** be less than `pRaygenShaderBindingTable->size`
bytes from `deviceAddress`.
`pRaygenShaderBindingTable->stride` is unused, and **must** be equal to
`pRaygenShaderBindingTable->size`.

For [vkCmdTraceRaysNV](#vkCmdTraceRaysNV), the location of the ray generation shader is
specified by the `raygenShaderBindingTableBuffer` and
`raygenShaderBindingOffset` parameters — there is no indexing.

The base for the computation of intersection, any-hit, and closest hit
shader locations is the `instanceShaderBindingTableRecordOffset` value
stored with each instance of a top-level acceleration structure
([VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR](accelstructures.html#VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR)).
This value determines the beginning of the shader binding table records for
a given instance.

In the following rule, `geometryIndex` refers to the
[geometry index](accelstructures.html#acceleration-structure-geometry-index) of the intersected
geometry within the instance.

The `sbtRecordOffset` and `sbtRecordStride` values are passed in as
parameters to
`traceNV`()
 or
`traceRayEXT`()
calls made in the shaders.
See Section 8.19 (Ray Tracing Functions) of the OpenGL Shading Language
Specification for more details.
In SPIR-V, these correspond to the `SBTOffset` and `SBTStride`
parameters to the [pipeline trace ray](../appendices/glossary.html#glossary-pipeline-trace-ray)
instructions.

The result of this computation is then added to
`pHitShaderBindingTable->deviceAddress`, a device address passed to
[vkCmdTraceRaysKHR](#vkCmdTraceRaysKHR)
, or
`hitShaderBindingOffset`, a base offset passed to [vkCmdTraceRaysNV](#vkCmdTraceRaysNV)
.

For [vkCmdTraceRaysKHR](#vkCmdTraceRaysKHR), the complete rule to compute a hit shader
binding table record address in the `pHitShaderBindingTable` is:

`pHitShaderBindingTable->deviceAddress` + 
`pHitShaderBindingTable->stride` × (
`instanceShaderBindingTableRecordOffset` + 
`geometryIndex` × `sbtRecordStride` + 
`sbtRecordOffset` )

All data accessed **must** be less than `pHitShaderBindingTable->size`
bytes from the base address.

For [vkCmdTraceRaysNV](#vkCmdTraceRaysNV), the offset and stride come from direct
parameters, so the full rule to compute a hit shader binding table record
address in the `hitShaderBindingTableBuffer` is:

`hitShaderBindingOffset` + 
`hitShaderBindingStride` × (
`instanceShaderBindingTableRecordOffset` + 
`geometryIndex` × `sbtRecordStride` + 
`sbtRecordOffset` )

A miss shader is executed whenever a ray query fails to find an intersection
for the given scene geometry.
Multiple miss shaders **may** be executed throughout a ray tracing dispatch.

The base for the computation of miss shader locations is
`pMissShaderBindingTable->deviceAddress`, a device address passed into
[vkCmdTraceRaysKHR](#vkCmdTraceRaysKHR)
, or
`missShaderBindingOffset`, a base offset passed into
[vkCmdTraceRaysNV](#vkCmdTraceRaysNV)
.

The `missIndex` value is passed in as a parameter to
`traceNV`()
 or
`traceRayEXT`()
calls made in the shaders.
See Section 8.19 (Ray Tracing Functions) of the OpenGL Shading Language
Specification for more details.
In SPIR-V, this corresponds to the `MissIndex` parameter to the
[pipeline trace ray](../appendices/glossary.html#glossary-pipeline-trace-ray) instructions.

For [vkCmdTraceRaysKHR](#vkCmdTraceRaysKHR), the complete rule to compute a miss shader
binding table record address in the `pMissShaderBindingTable` is:

`pMissShaderBindingTable->deviceAddress` + 
`pMissShaderBindingTable->stride` × `missIndex`

All data accessed **must** be less than `pMissShaderBindingTable->size`
bytes from the base address.

For [vkCmdTraceRaysNV](#vkCmdTraceRaysNV), the offset and stride come from direct
parameters, so the full rule to compute a miss shader binding table record
address in the `missShaderBindingTableBuffer` is:

`missShaderBindingOffset` + 
`missShaderBindingStride` × `missIndex`

A callable shader is executed when requested by a ray tracing shader.
Multiple callable shaders **may** be executed throughout a ray tracing
dispatch.

The base for the computation of callable shader locations is
`pCallableShaderBindingTable->deviceAddress`, a device address passed
into [vkCmdTraceRaysKHR](#vkCmdTraceRaysKHR)
, or
`callableShaderBindingOffset`, a base offset passed into
[vkCmdTraceRaysNV](#vkCmdTraceRaysNV)
.

The `sbtRecordIndex` value is passed in as a parameter to
`executeCallableNV`()
 or
`executeCallableEXT`()
calls made in the shaders.
See Section 8.19 (Ray Tracing Functions) of the OpenGL Shading Language
Specification for more details.
In SPIR-V, this corresponds to the `SBTIndex` parameter to the
`OpExecuteCallableNV`
 or
`OpExecuteCallableKHR`
instruction.

For [vkCmdTraceRaysKHR](#vkCmdTraceRaysKHR), the complete rule to compute a callable shader
binding table record address in the `pCallableShaderBindingTable` is:

`pCallableShaderBindingTable->deviceAddress` + 
`pCallableShaderBindingTable->stride` ×
`sbtRecordIndex`

All data accessed **must** be less than `pCallableShaderBindingTable->size`
bytes from the base address.

For [vkCmdTraceRaysNV](#vkCmdTraceRaysNV), the offset and stride come from direct
parameters, so the full rule to compute a callable shader binding table
record address in the `callableShaderBindingTableBuffer` is:

`callableShaderBindingOffset` + 
`callableShaderBindingStride` × `sbtRecordIndex`

Ray tracing pipelines have a potentially large set of shaders which **may** be
invoked in various call chain combinations to perform ray tracing.
To store parameters for a given shader execution, an implementation **may** use
a stack of data in memory.
This stack **must** be sized to the sum of the stack sizes of all shaders in
any call chain executed by the application.

If the stack size is not set explicitly, the stack size for a pipeline is:

rayGenStackMax +  min(1,
`maxPipelineRayRecursionDepth`) ×
max(closestHitStackMax, missStackMax, intersectionStackMax
+  anyHitStackMax) +  max(0,
`maxPipelineRayRecursionDepth`-1) ×
max(closestHitStackMax, missStackMax) +  2 ×
callableStackMax

where rayGenStackMax, closestHitStackMax, missStackMax,
anyHitStackMax, intersectionStackMax, and callableStackMax
are the maximum stack values queried by the respective shader stages for any
shaders in any shader groups defined by the pipeline.

This stack size is potentially significant, so an application **may** want to
provide a more accurate stack size after pipeline compilation.
The value that the application provides is the maximum value of the sum of
all shaders in a call chain across all possible call chains, taking into
account any application specific knowledge about the properties of the call
chains.

|  | For example, if an application has two types of closest hit and miss shaders
| --- | --- |
that it can use but the first level of rays will only use the first kind
(possibly reflection) and the second level will only use the second kind
(occlusion or shadow ray, for example) then the application can compute the
stack size by something similar to:

`rayGenStack` +  max(`closestHit1Stack`,
`miss1Stack`) +  max(`closestHit2Stack`,
`miss2Stack`)

This is guaranteed to be no larger than the default stack size computation
which assumes that both call levels may be the larger of the two. |

In a similar way to
[bufferDeviceAddressCaptureReplay](features.html#features-bufferDeviceAddressCaptureReplay),
the [`rayTracingPipelineShaderGroupHandleCaptureReplay`](features.html#features-rayTracingPipelineShaderGroupHandleCaptureReplay) feature allows the
querying of opaque data which **can** be used in a future replay.

During the capture phase, capture/replay tools are expected to query opaque
data for shader group handle replay using
[vkGetRayTracingCaptureReplayShaderGroupHandlesKHR](pipelines.html#vkGetRayTracingCaptureReplayShaderGroupHandlesKHR).

Providing the opaque data during replay, using
[VkRayTracingShaderGroupCreateInfoKHR](pipelines.html#VkRayTracingShaderGroupCreateInfoKHR)::`pShaderGroupCaptureReplayHandle`
at pipeline creation time, causes the implementation to generate identical
shader group handles to those in the capture phase, allowing capture/replay
tools to reuse previously recorded shader binding table buffer contents or
to obtain the same handles by calling
[vkGetRayTracingCaptureReplayShaderGroupHandlesKHR](pipelines.html#vkGetRayTracingCaptureReplayShaderGroupHandlesKHR) again.

Ray tracing validation **can** help root cause application issues and improve
performance.
Unlike existing validation layers, ray tracing validation performs checks at
an implementation level, which helps identify potential problems that **may**
not be caught by the layer.

By enabling the [ray tracing validation](features.html#features-rayTracingValidation)
feature, warnings and errors **can** be delivered straight from a ray tracing
implementation to the application through a [messenger callback](debugging.html#debugging-debug-messengers) registered with the implementation, where they **can** be
processed through existing application-side debugging or logging systems.
