## Content

*Acceleration structures* are data structures used by the implementation to
efficiently manage scene geometry as it is [traversed during a ray tracing query](raytraversal.html#ray-traversal).
The application is responsible for managing acceleration structure objects
(see [Acceleration Structures](resources.html#resources-acceleration-structures)),
including allocation, destruction, executing builds or updates, and
synchronizing resources used during ray tracing queries.

There are two types of acceleration structures, *top level acceleration
structures* and *bottom level acceleration structures*.

An acceleration structure is considered to be constructed if an
[acceleration structure build command](#acceleration-structure-building) or
[copy command](#acceleration-structure-copying) has been executed with the
given acceleration structure as the destination.

Figure 1. Acceleration Structure

Caption

The diagram shows the relationship between top and bottom level acceleration
structures.

*Geometries* refer to a triangle,
sphere, linear swept sphere (LSS),
or axis-aligned bounding box.

A triangle is a fundamental geometric primitive defined by three vertices in
3D space, forming a flat, planar surface.

An axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is a rectangular box defined by two
points (minimum and maximum corners) that encloses a 3D object or scene.
Its faces are aligned with the coordinate axes, making intersection tests
efficient for spatial partitioning and acceleration structures.

A sphere primitive is defined by a position and a radius.

The linear swept sphere (LSS) primitive is comprised of two sphere endcaps
and a truncated cone midsection.
The midsection is constructed so that it tangentially intersects with the
endcaps.
Two points, P0 and P1, and two radii, r0 and
r1, fully describe the primitive.

The following figure shows an example of the LSS primitive composed of two
sphere endcaps connected by a midsection.
The solid non-dotted outline indicates the intersectable portion of the
primitive.

![lss primitive](../_images/lss_primitive.svg)

Figure 2. LSS primitive

Endcaps on LSS primitives are optional and are controlled by
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV](#VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV)::`endCapsMode`.
The following figure shows an example of the LSS primitive without the
endcaps with only the midsection present.

![lss primitive no endcaps](../_images/lss_primitive_no_endcaps.svg)

Figure 3. LSS primitive with no endcaps

A LSS geometry can be defined in multiple ways.
If only the vertex and radius data are specified in
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV](#VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV) without
specifying the index data, LSS primitives are drawn in pairs of vertices.
Each primitive i is defined by entries (i × 2, i × 2
+  1) in the vertex and radius buffers.
For example, if a vertex buffer contains vertices A, B, C, D, E, F and
G, (assuming each character represents a position vector) with
corresponding radii as rA, rB, rC, rD, rE, rF and rG respectively, the
LSS primitives drawn will be as shown below with G skipped because it
does not have a corresponding vertex pair.

![lssWithVertexBuffers](../_images/lssWithVertexBuffers.svg)

Figure 4. Lss primitives drawn with only vertex data

LSS primitives **can** be chained together by specifying an index buffer and
indexing mode in the
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV](#VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV) structure.

If the [VkRayTracingLssIndexingModeNV](#VkRayTracingLssIndexingModeNV)::`indexingMode` is set to
`VK_RAY_TRACING_LSS_INDEXING_MODE_LIST_NV`, then the consecutive pair of
indices in the index buffer select the vertices that define the LSS chain.
For example, assuming the same vertex buffer as before, if the index buffer
contains indices [6, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1], the LSS primitives will be
chained as shown:

![lssWithListIndexingMode](../_images/lssWithListIndexingMode.svg)

Figure 5. Lss primitives drawn with VK_RAY_TRACING_LSS_INDEXING_MODE_LIST_NV indexing mode

Note that due to the lack of a [3, 2] pair, there is a break in the
chain and D is not connected to C.

If the [VkRayTracingLssIndexingModeNV](#VkRayTracingLssIndexingModeNV)::`indexingMode` is set to
`VK_RAY_TRACING_LSS_INDEXING_MODE_SUCCESSIVE_NV`, then each LSS
primitive is defined by two successive positions and radii, (k, k

1), where k is a single index in the index buffer.
For example, if the index buffer contains indices [0, 1, 2, 4], the
LSS primitives will be chained as shown below.
Note that due to the absence of index 3 in the index buffer, there is a
break in the chain and D is not connected to E.

Opaque acceleration structure for an array of instances.
The descriptor or device address referencing this is the starting point for
traversal.

The top level acceleration structure takes a reference to any bottom level
acceleration structure referenced by its instances.
Those bottom level acceleration structure objects **must** be valid when the
top level acceleration structure is accessed.

Opaque acceleration structure for an array of geometries.

The API defines two types of operations to produce acceleration structures
from geometry:

* 
A *build* operation is used to construct an acceleration structure.

* 
An *update* operation is used to modify an existing acceleration
structure.

An update operation imposes certain constraints on the input, in exchange
for considerably faster execution.
When performing an update, the application is required to provide a full
description of the acceleration structure, but is prohibited from changing
anything other than instance definitions, transform matrices, and vertex or
AABB positions.
All other aspects of the description **must** exactly match the one from the
original build.

More precisely, the application **must** not use an update operation to do any
of the following:

* 
Change primitives or instances from *active* to *inactive*, or vice
versa (as defined in [Inactive Primitives and Instances](#acceleration-structure-inactive-prims)).

* 
Change the index or vertex formats of triangle geometry.

* 
Change triangle geometry transform pointers from null to non-null or
vice versa.

* 
Change the number of geometries or instances in the structure.

* 
Change the geometry flags for any geometry in the structure.

* 
Change the number of vertices or primitives for any geometry in the
structure.

If the original acceleration structure was built using opacity micromaps and
`VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_ALLOW_OPACITY_MICROMAP_DATA_UPDATE_BIT_EXT`
was set in `flags`, the application **must** provide a micromap matching
the original micromap in structure with only opacity values updated.
The application is prohibited from changing anything other than the specific
opacity values assigned to the triangles.

More precisely, the application **must** not use an update operation to do any
of the following:

* 
Remove micromaps or [VkOpacityMicromapSpecialIndexEXT](#VkOpacityMicromapSpecialIndexEXT) values from a
geometry which previously had them, or vice versa.

* 
Change between use of [VkOpacityMicromapSpecialIndexEXT](#VkOpacityMicromapSpecialIndexEXT) values and
explicit micro-map triangles.

* 
Change the subdivision level or format of the micromap triangle
associated with any acceleration-structure triangle.

If the original acceleration structure was built using opacity micromaps and
`VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_ALLOW_OPACITY_MICROMAP_UPDATE_BIT_EXT`
was set in `flags`, the application **must** provide a micromap to the
update operation.

If [VkMicromapBuildSizesInfoEXT](resources.html#VkMicromapBuildSizesInfoEXT)::`discardable` is `VK_FALSE`, a
`VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_ALLOW_OPACITY_MICROMAP_DATA_UPDATE_BIT_EXT`
or
`VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_ALLOW_OPACITY_MICROMAP_UPDATE_BIT_EXT`
operation transfers the reference in the acceleration structure to the new
micromap.

If the original acceleration structure was built using opacity micromaps and
neither opacity micromap update flag is set the application **must** provide
the original micromap to the update operation.

If the original acceleration structure was built using displacement
micromaps and
`VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_ALLOW_DISPLACEMENT_MICROMAP_UPDATE_BIT_NV`
was set in `flags`, the application **must** provide a displacement
micromap to the update operation.

If the original acceleration structure was built using displacement
micromaps and the displacement micromap update flag is not set the
application **must** provide the original micromap to the update operation.

Acceleration structures allow the use of particular input values to signal
*inactive* primitives or instances.

An *inactive* triangle is one for which the first (X) component of any
vertex is NaN.
If any other vertex component is NaN, and the first is not, the behavior is
**undefined**.
If the vertex format does not have a NaN representation, then all triangles
are considered active.

An *inactive* instance is one whose acceleration structure reference is `0`.

An *inactive* AABB is one for which the minimum X coordinate is NaN.
If any other component is NaN, and the first is not, the behavior is
**undefined**.

An *inactive* LSS or sphere is one where any of the radius or position
component is NaN.

In the above definitions, “NaN” refers to any type of NaN.
Signaling, non-signaling, quiet, loud, or otherwise.

An inactive object is considered invisible to all rays, and **should** not be
represented in the acceleration structure.
Implementations **should** ensure that the presence of inactive objects does
not seriously degrade traversal performance.

Inactive objects are counted in the auto-generated index sequences which are
provided to shaders via `InstanceId` and `PrimitiveId` SPIR-V
decorations.
This allows objects in the scene to change freely between the active and
inactive states, without affecting the layout of any arrays which are being
indexed using the ID values.

Any transition between the active and inactive states requires a full
acceleration structure rebuild.
Applications **must** not perform an acceleration structure update where an
object is active in the source acceleration structure but would be inactive
in the destination, or vice versa.

The active/inactive state of primitives **must** not be changed with
acceleration structure updates.
For chained LSS, using the
`VK_RAY_TRACING_LSS_PRIMITIVE_END_CAPS_MODE_CHAINED_NV` mode, entire
chains **must** be either active or inactive.
If any chain contains both active and inactive primitives, the behavior is
**undefined**.

*Degenerate* primitives and instances behave differently to
[inactive primitives and instances](#acceleration-structure-inactive-prims),
and are defined as:

* 
triangles that have one or more vertices whose respective (X), (Y), (Z)
components are identical, or have three vertices that have at least two
of the (X), (Y), or (Z) components identical, therefore forming a line
or point.
Degenerate triangles do not generate any intersections.

* 
AABBs whose `minX`=`maxX`, `minY`=`maxY`, and
`minZ`=`maxZ`.
Degenerate AABBs **may** invoke the intersection shader.

* 
LSS primitives where both the radii are set to `0`.

* 
sphere primitives whose radius is set to `0`.

* 
instances that reference bottom level acceleration structures that
contain no active primitives.
When building an acceleration structure, implementations **should** treat
degenerate instances as though they are a point at the instance origin,
specified by [VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR)::`transform`.

Unlike *inactive* primitives and instances, *degenerate* primitives and
instances **may** transition from the degenerate to the non-degenerate state,
or vice versa, when performing an acceleration structure update.

If an acceleration structure is built without
`VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_ALLOW_UPDATE_BIT_KHR` set in
[VkAccelerationStructureInfoNV](resources.html#VkAccelerationStructureInfoNV)::`flags`
or
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR)::`flags`
, degenerate primitives **may** be discarded.
Primitives that are defined with the same index value for more than one
vertex **can** always be discarded.

To build acceleration structures call:

// Provided by VK_KHR_acceleration_structure
void vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    infoCount,
    const VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR* pInfos,
    const VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR* const* ppBuildRangeInfos);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be
recorded.

* 
`infoCount` is the number of acceleration structures to build.
It specifies the number of the `pInfos` structures and
`ppBuildRangeInfos` pointers that **must** be provided.

* 
`pInfos` is a pointer to an array of `infoCount`
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR) structures defining
the geometry used to build each acceleration structure.

* 
`ppBuildRangeInfos` is a pointer to an array of `infoCount`
pointers to arrays of [VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR)
structures.
Each `ppBuildRangeInfos`[i] is a pointer to an array of
`pInfos`[i].`geometryCount`
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR) structures defining
dynamic offsets to the addresses where geometry data is stored, as
defined by `pInfos`[i].

The `vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR` command provides the ability
to initiate multiple acceleration structures builds, however there is no
ordering or synchronization implied between any of the individual
acceleration structure builds.

|  | This means that an application **cannot** build a top-level acceleration
| --- | --- |
structure in the same [vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](#vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR) call as the
associated bottom-level or instance acceleration structures are being built.
There also **cannot** be any memory aliasing between any acceleration structure
memories or scratch memories being used by any of the builds. |

|  | A [VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR) structure is not used when
| --- | --- |
building an acceleration structure with a geometry type of
`VK_GEOMETRY_TYPE_DENSE_GEOMETRY_FORMAT_TRIANGLES_AMDX`. |

Accesses to the acceleration structure scratch buffers as identified by the
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR)::`scratchData` buffer
device addresses **must** be [synchronized](synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies) with
the `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages) and an
[access type](synchronization.html#synchronization-access-types) of
(`VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_READ_BIT_KHR` |
`VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_WRITE_BIT_KHR`).
Accesses to each
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR)::`srcAccelerationStructure`
and
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR)::`dstAccelerationStructure`
**must** be [synchronized](synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies) with the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages) and an
[access type](synchronization.html#synchronization-access-types) of
`VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_READ_BIT_KHR` or
`VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_WRITE_BIT_KHR`, as appropriate.

Accesses to other input buffers as identified by any used values of
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryMotionTrianglesDataNV](#VkAccelerationStructureGeometryMotionTrianglesDataNV)::`vertexData`,
[VkAccelerationStructureDenseGeometryFormatTrianglesDataAMDX](#VkAccelerationStructureDenseGeometryFormatTrianglesDataAMDX)::`compressedData`,

[synchronized](synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies) with the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages) and an

Conditional Rendering

vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresIndirectKHR is not affected by [conditional rendering](drawing.html#drawing-conditional-rendering)

The `VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_acceleration_structure
typedef struct VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR {
    VkStructureType                                     sType;
    const void*                                         pNext;
    VkAccelerationStructureTypeKHR                      type;
    VkBuildAccelerationStructureFlagsKHR                flags;
    VkBuildAccelerationStructureModeKHR                 mode;
    VkAccelerationStructureKHR                          srcAccelerationStructure;
    VkAccelerationStructureKHR                          dstAccelerationStructure;
    uint32_t                                            geometryCount;
    const VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR*           pGeometries;
    const VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR* const*    ppGeometries;
    VkDeviceOrHostAddressKHR                            scratchData;
} VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](fundamentals.html#VkStructureType) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`type` is a [VkAccelerationStructureTypeKHR](resources.html#VkAccelerationStructureTypeKHR) value specifying
the type of acceleration structure being built.

* 
`flags` is a bitmask of
[VkBuildAccelerationStructureFlagBitsKHR](resources.html#VkBuildAccelerationStructureFlagBitsKHR) specifying additional
parameters of the acceleration structure.

* 
`mode` is a [VkBuildAccelerationStructureModeKHR](#VkBuildAccelerationStructureModeKHR) value
specifying the type of operation to perform.

* 
`srcAccelerationStructure` is a pointer to an existing acceleration
structure that is to be used to update the
`dstAccelerationStructure` acceleration structure when `mode` is
`VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_UPDATE_KHR`.

* 
`dstAccelerationStructure` is a pointer to the target acceleration
structure for the build.

* 
`geometryCount` specifies the number of geometries that will be
built into `dstAccelerationStructure`.

* 
`pGeometries` is a pointer to an array of
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR) structures.

* 
`ppGeometries` is a pointer to an array of pointers to
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR) structures.

* 
`scratchData` is the device or host address to memory that will be
used as scratch memory for the build.

Only one of `pGeometries` or `ppGeometries` **can** be a valid pointer,
the other **must** be `NULL`.
Each element of the non-`NULL` array describes the data used to build each
acceleration structure geometry.

The index of each element of the `pGeometries` or `ppGeometries`
members of [VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR) is used as the
*geometry index* during ray traversal.
The geometry index is available in ray shaders via the
[`RayGeometryIndexKHR` built-in](interfaces.html#interfaces-builtin-variables-raygeometryindex), and is [used to determine hit and intersection shaders executed during traversal](raytracing.html#shader-binding-table-hit-shader-indexing).
The geometry index is available to ray queries via the
`OpRayQueryGetIntersectionGeometryIndexKHR` instruction.

Setting `VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MOTION_BIT_NV` in `flags`
indicates that this build is a motion top level acceleration structure.
A motion top level uses instances of format
[VkAccelerationStructureMotionInstanceNV](#VkAccelerationStructureMotionInstanceNV) if
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryInstancesDataKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureGeometryInstancesDataKHR)::`arrayOfPointers`
is `VK_FALSE`.

If
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryInstancesDataKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureGeometryInstancesDataKHR)::`arrayOfPointers`
is `VK_TRUE`, the pointer for each element of the array of instance
pointers consists of 4 bits of
`VkAccelerationStructureMotionInstanceTypeNV` in the low 4 bits of the
pointer identifying the type of structure at the pointer.
The device address accessed is the value in the array with the low 4 bits
set to zero.
The structure at the pointer is one of
[VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR),
[VkAccelerationStructureMatrixMotionInstanceNV](#VkAccelerationStructureMatrixMotionInstanceNV) or
[VkAccelerationStructureSRTMotionInstanceNV](#VkAccelerationStructureSRTMotionInstanceNV), depending on the type
value encoded in the low 4 bits.

A top level acceleration structure with either motion instances or vertex
motion in its instances **must** set
`VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MOTION_BIT_NV` in `flags`.

Members `srcAccelerationStructure` and `dstAccelerationStructure`
**may** be the same or different for an update operation (when `mode` is
`VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_UPDATE_KHR`).
If they are the same, the update happens in-place.
Otherwise, the target acceleration structure is updated and the source is
not modified.

*Acceleration structure instances* **can** be built into top-level acceleration
structures.
Each acceleration structure instance is a separate entry in the top-level
acceleration structure which includes all the geometry of a bottom-level
acceleration structure at a transformed location.
Multiple instances **can** point to the same bottom level acceleration
structure.

An acceleration structure instance is defined by the structure:

// Provided by VK_KHR_acceleration_structure
typedef struct VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR {

`instanceShaderBindingTableRecordOffset` is a 24-bit offset used in
calculating the hit shader binding table index.

structure built using

a [VkAccelerationStructureKHR](resources.html#VkAccelerationStructureKHR) object (used by host operations
which reference acceleration structures).

The C language specification does not define the ordering of bit-fields, but
in practice, this structure produces the correct layout with existing
compilers.
The intended bit pattern is for the following:

* 
`instanceCustomIndex` and `mask` occupy the same memory as if a
single `uint32_t` was specified in their place

`instanceCustomIndex` occupies the 24 least significant bits of
that memory

* 
`mask` occupies the 8 most significant bits of that memory

`instanceShaderBindingTableRecordOffset` and `flags` occupy the
same memory as if a single `uint32_t` was specified in their place

* 
`instanceShaderBindingTableRecordOffset` occupies the 24 least
significant bits of that memory

* 
`flags` occupies the 8 most significant bits of that memory

If a compiler produces code that diverges from that pattern, applications
**must** employ another method to set values according to the correct bit
pattern.

The transform for a matrix motion instance at a point in time is derived by
component-wise linear interpolation of the two transforms.
That is, for a `time` in [0,1] the resulting transform is

An acceleration structure SRT motion instance is defined by the structure:

// Provided by VK_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur
typedef struct VkAccelerationStructureSRTMotionInstanceNV {
    VkSRTDataNV                   transformT0;
    VkSRTDataNV                   transformT1;

    VkGeometryInstanceFlagsKHR    flags:8;

} VkAccelerationStructureSRTMotionInstanceNV;

* 
`transformT0` is a [VkSRTDataNV](#VkSRTDataNV) structure describing a
transformation to be applied to the acceleration structure at time 0.

* 
`transformT1` is a [VkSRTDataNV](#VkSRTDataNV) structure describing a
transformation to be applied to the acceleration structure at time 1.

* 
`instanceCustomIndex` is a 24-bit application-specified index value
accessible to ray shaders in the `InstanceCustomIndexKHR` built-in.

* 
`mask` is an 8-bit visibility mask for the geometry.
The instance **may** only be hit if `Cull Mask & instance.mask != 0`

* 
`instanceShaderBindingTableRecordOffset` is a 24-bit offset used in
calculating the hit shader binding table index.

* 
`flags` is an 8-bit mask of [VkGeometryInstanceFlagBitsKHR](#VkGeometryInstanceFlagBitsKHR)
values to apply to this instance.

* 
`accelerationStructureReference` is either:

a device address containing the value obtained from
[vkGetAccelerationStructureDeviceAddressKHR](resources.html#vkGetAccelerationStructureDeviceAddressKHR)
or
[vkGetAccelerationStructureHandleNV](resources.html#vkGetAccelerationStructureHandleNV)
     (used by device operations which reference acceleration structures) or,

* 
a [VkAccelerationStructureKHR](resources.html#VkAccelerationStructureKHR) object (used by host operations
which reference acceleration structures).

The C language specification does not define the ordering of bit-fields, but
in practice, this structure produces the correct layout with existing
compilers.
The intended bit pattern is for the following:

* 
`instanceCustomIndex` and `mask` occupy the same memory as if a
single `uint32_t` was specified in their place

`instanceCustomIndex` occupies the 24 least significant bits of
that memory

* 
`mask` occupies the 8 most significant bits of that memory

`instanceShaderBindingTableRecordOffset` and `flags` occupy the
same memory as if a single `uint32_t` was specified in their place

* 
`instanceShaderBindingTableRecordOffset` occupies the 24 least
significant bits of that memory

* 
`flags` occupies the 8 most significant bits of that memory

If a compiler produces code that diverges from that pattern, applications
**must** employ another method to set values according to the correct bit
pattern.

The transform for a SRT motion instance at a point in time is derived from
component-wise linear interpolation of the two SRT transforms.
That is, for a `time` in [0,1] the resulting transform is

`transformT0` × (1 - `time`) + 
`transformT1` × `time`

An acceleration structure SRT transform is defined by the structure:

} VkSRTDataNV;

*

*

* 
`b` is one component of the shear for the transform

* 
`pvx` is the x component of the pivot point of the transform

* 
`sy` is the y component of the scale of the transform

* 
`tx` is the x component of the post-rotation translation

* 
`ty` is the y component of the post-rotation translation

* 
`tz` is the z component of the post-rotation translation

This transform decomposition consists of three elements.
The first is a matrix S, consisting of a scale, shear, and translation,
usually used to define the pivot point of the following rotation.
This matrix is constructed from the parameters above by:

  

  

The rotation quaternion is defined as:

`R` = [ `qx`, `qy`, `qz`, `qw` ]

This is a rotation around a conceptual normalized axis [ ax, ay, az ]
of amount `theta` such that:

[ `qx`, `qy`, `qz` ] = sin(`theta`/2)
× [ `ax`, `ay`, `az` ]

and

`qw` = cos(`theta`/2)

Finally, the transform has a translation T constructed from the parameters
above by:

  

  

The effective derived transform is then given by

`T` × `R` × `S`

The value of `firstVertex` is added to the index values before
fetching vertices and radii.

indices are consumed from
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV](#VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV)::`indexData`,
starting at an offset of `primitiveOffset`.

 `endCapsMode` **must** be a valid [VkRayTracingLssPrimitiveEndCapsModeNV](#VkRayTracingLssPrimitiveEndCapsModeNV) value

Chaining LSS primitives **can** be achieved by specifying an index buffer in
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV](#VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV)::`indexData`
and setting
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV](#VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV)::`indexingMode`
to one of `VkRayTracingLssIndexingModeNV` values:

// Provided by VK_NV_ray_tracing_linear_swept_spheres
typedef enum VkRayTracingLssIndexingModeNV {
    VK_RAY_TRACING_LSS_INDEXING_MODE_LIST_NV = 0,
    VK_RAY_TRACING_LSS_INDEXING_MODE_SUCCESSIVE_NV = 1,
} VkRayTracingLssIndexingModeNV;

* 
`VK_RAY_TRACING_LSS_INDEXING_MODE_LIST_NV` specifies that a list of
indices is provided where each consecutive pair of indices define a LSS
primitive.

* 
`VK_RAY_TRACING_LSS_INDEXING_MODE_SUCCESSIVE_NV` specifies a
successive implicit indexing format, in which each LSS primitive is
defined by two successive positions and radii, (k, k + 1), where
k is a single index provided in the index buffer.
In this indexing scheme, there is a 1:1 mapping between the index buffer
and primitive index within the geometry.

The default behavior with endcaps in a LSS chain is that both endcaps will
be enabled for all beginning and end points.
To change the LSS chain’s endcaps mode use
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV](#VkAccelerationStructureGeometryLinearSweptSpheresDataNV)::`endCapsMode`.
The possible values for `endCapsMode` are:

// Provided by VK_NV_ray_tracing_linear_swept_spheres
typedef enum VkRayTracingLssPrimitiveEndCapsModeNV {
    VK_RAY_TRACING_LSS_PRIMITIVE_END_CAPS_MODE_NONE_NV = 0,
    VK_RAY_TRACING_LSS_PRIMITIVE_END_CAPS_MODE_CHAINED_NV = 1,
} VkRayTracingLssPrimitiveEndCapsModeNV;

* 
`VK_RAY_TRACING_LSS_PRIMITIVE_END_CAPS_MODE_NONE_NV` disables all
endcaps and the chain boundaries have no influence.

* 
`VK_RAY_TRACING_LSS_PRIMITIVE_END_CAPS_MODE_CHAINED_NV` specifies
that when `VK_RAY_TRACING_LSS_INDEXING_MODE_SUCCESSIVE_NV` is used
as indexing mode for the LSS primitive, the first primitive in each
chain will have both endcaps enabled, and every following primitive in
the chain only has endcaps at the trailing position enabled.

In addition to LSS primitives, simple sphere geometry is also supported.
Spheres do not have an endcap mode.
If an index buffer is present, each entry represents a single position and
radius describing one sphere primitive.
If no index buffer is provided, the vertex position and radius values are
sequentially read from the corresponding buffers.

If `VkAccelerationStructureGeometrySpheresDataNV` is included in the
`pNext` chain of a [VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR) structure,
then that structures defines the sphere’s geometry data.

The `VkAccelerationStructureGeometrySpheresDataNV` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_NV_ray_tracing_linear_swept_spheres
typedef struct VkAccelerationStructureGeometrySpheresDataNV {
    VkStructureType                  sType;
    const void*                      pNext;

    VkDeviceOrHostAddressConstKHR    indexData;
    VkDeviceSize                     indexStride;
} VkAccelerationStructureGeometrySpheresDataNV;

An additional command exists for copying acceleration structures without
updating their contents.
The acceleration structure object **can** be compacted in order to improve
performance.
Before copying, an application **must** query the size of the resulting
acceleration structure.

To query acceleration structure size parameters call:

// Provided by VK_KHR_acceleration_structure
void vkCmdWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    accelerationStructureCount,
    const VkAccelerationStructureKHR*           pAccelerationStructures,
    VkQueryType                                 queryType,
    VkQueryPool                                 queryPool,
    uint32_t                                    firstQuery);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be
recorded.

* 
`accelerationStructureCount` is the count of acceleration structures
for which to query the property.

* 
`pAccelerationStructures` is a pointer to an array of existing
previously built acceleration structures.

* 
`queryType` is a [VkQueryType](queries.html#VkQueryType) value specifying the type of
queries managed by the pool.

* 
`queryPool` is the query pool that will manage the results of the
query.

* 
`firstQuery` is the first query index within the query pool that
will contain the `accelerationStructureCount` number of results.

Accesses to any of the acceleration structures listed in
`pAccelerationStructures` **must** be [synchronized](synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies) with the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_COPY_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages) or the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages), and an
[access type](synchronization.html#synchronization-access-types) of
`VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_READ_BIT_KHR`.

* 
If `queryType` is
`VK_QUERY_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_COMPACTED_SIZE_KHR`, then the
value written out is the number of bytes required by a compacted
acceleration structure.

* 
If `queryType` is
`VK_QUERY_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_SERIALIZATION_SIZE_KHR`, then

Conditional Rendering

vkCmdCopyAccelerationStructureNV is not affected by [conditional rendering](drawing.html#drawing-conditional-rendering)

Possible values of `mode` specifying additional operations to perform
during the copy, are:

// Provided by VK_KHR_acceleration_structure
typedef enum VkCopyAccelerationStructureModeKHR {
    VK_COPY_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_CLONE_KHR = 0,
    VK_COPY_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_COMPACT_KHR = 1,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_acceleration_structure
    VK_COPY_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_SERIALIZE_KHR = 2,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_acceleration_structure
    VK_COPY_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_DESERIALIZE_KHR = 3,
  // Provided by VK_NV_ray_tracing
    VK_COPY_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_CLONE_NV = VK_COPY_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_CLONE_KHR,
  // Provided by VK_NV_ray_tracing
    VK_COPY_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_COMPACT_NV = VK_COPY_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_COMPACT_KHR,
} VkCopyAccelerationStructureModeKHR;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_NV_ray_tracing
typedef VkCopyAccelerationStructureModeKHR VkCopyAccelerationStructureModeNV;

* 
`VK_COPY_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_CLONE_KHR` creates a direct
copy of the acceleration structure specified in `src` into the one
specified by `dst`.
The `dst` acceleration structure **must** have been created with the
same parameters as `src`.
If `src` contains references to other acceleration structures,
`dst` will reference the same acceleration structures.

* 
`VK_COPY_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_COMPACT_KHR` creates a more
    compact version of an acceleration structure `src` into `dst`.
    The acceleration structure `dst` **must** have been created with a size
    at least as large as that returned by
[vkCmdWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesNV](#vkCmdWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesNV)
,
    [vkCmdWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR](#vkCmdWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR), or
    [vkWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR](#vkWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR)
    after the build of the acceleration structure specified by `src`.
    If `src` contains references to other acceleration structures,
    `dst` will reference the same acceleration structures.

* 
`VK_COPY_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_SERIALIZE_KHR` serializes the
acceleration structure to a semi-opaque format which can be reloaded on
a compatible implementation.

* 
`VK_COPY_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_DESERIALIZE_KHR` deserializes
the semi-opaque serialization format in the buffer to the acceleration
structure.

To copy an acceleration structure to device memory call:

// Provided by VK_KHR_acceleration_structure
void vkCmdCopyAccelerationStructureToMemoryKHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkCopyAccelerationStructureToMemoryInfoKHR* pInfo);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be
recorded.

* 
`pInfo` is an a pointer to a
[VkCopyAccelerationStructureToMemoryInfoKHR](#VkCopyAccelerationStructureToMemoryInfoKHR) structure defining the
copy operation.

Accesses to `pInfo->src` **must** be [synchronized](synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies) with the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_COPY_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages) or the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages), and an
[access type](synchronization.html#synchronization-access-types) of
`VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_READ_BIT_KHR`.
Accesses to the buffer indicated by `pInfo->dst.deviceAddress` **must** be
synchronized with the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_COPY_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages) or the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages), and an and an access
type of `VK_ACCESS_TRANSFER_WRITE_BIT`.

This command produces the same results as
[vkCopyAccelerationStructureToMemoryKHR](#vkCopyAccelerationStructureToMemoryKHR), but writes its result to a
device address, and is executed on the device rather than the host.
The output **may** not necessarily be bit-for-bit identical, but it can be
equally used by either [vkCmdCopyMemoryToAccelerationStructureKHR](#vkCmdCopyMemoryToAccelerationStructureKHR) or
[vkCopyMemoryToAccelerationStructureKHR](#vkCopyMemoryToAccelerationStructureKHR).

The defined header structure for the serialized data consists of:

* 
`VK_UUID_SIZE` bytes of data matching
`VkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties`::`driverUUID`

* 
`VK_UUID_SIZE` bytes of data identifying the compatibility for
comparison using [vkGetDeviceAccelerationStructureCompatibilityKHR](#vkGetDeviceAccelerationStructureCompatibilityKHR)

* 
A 64-bit integer of the total size matching the value queried using
`VK_QUERY_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_SERIALIZATION_SIZE_KHR`

* 
A 64-bit integer of the deserialized size to be passed in to
`VkAccelerationStructureCreateInfoKHR`::`size`

* 
A 64-bit integer of the count of the number of acceleration structure
handles following.
This value matches the value queried using
`VK_QUERY_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_SERIALIZATION_BOTTOM_LEVEL_POINTERS_KHR`.
This will be zero for a bottom-level acceleration structure.
For top-level acceleration structures this number is
implementation-dependent; the number of and ordering of the handles may
not match the instance descriptions which were used to build the
acceleration structure.

The corresponding handles matching the values returned by
[vkGetAccelerationStructureDeviceAddressKHR](resources.html#vkGetAccelerationStructureDeviceAddressKHR)
or
[vkGetAccelerationStructureHandleNV](resources.html#vkGetAccelerationStructureHandleNV)
are tightly packed in the buffer following the count.
The application is expected to store a mapping between those handles and the
original application-generated bottom-level acceleration structures to
provide when deserializing.
The serialized data is written to the buffer (or read from the buffer)
according to the host endianness.

Acceleration structure build times in ray tracing applications with
extensive geometry **can** be reduced by introducing alternative acceleration
structure types that facilitate bottom-level acceleration structure
construction using pre-generated primitive clusters, improving geometry
reuse.
This **can** be achieved by incorporating additional acceleration structure
types:

[Cluster Level Acceleration    Structure](#acceleration-structure-clas-geometry)

[Cluster Template Acceleration    Structure](#acceleration-structure-clas-template)

[Cluster Level Bottom Level    Acceleration Structure](#acceleration-structure-bottom-level-clas)

Cluster Level Acceleration Structure (CLAS) is an intermediate acceleration
structure constructed from triangles, which serves as a building block for
[Cluster Level Bottom Level Acceleration Structure](#acceleration-structure-bottom-level-clas).
A CLAS shares similarities with a traditional
[bottom level acceleration structure](#acceleration-structure-bottom-level)
but has several key distinctions.
A CLAS **can** only contain a limited number of [triangles and vertices](#cluster-geometry-limits).
CLAS objects cannot be directly referenced in a top level acceleration
structure, instead, they **must** be part of a
[Cluster Level Bottom Level Acceleration Structure](#acceleration-structure-bottom-level-clas).
The [geometry indices](#cluster-geometry-index-flags) within a CLAS are
local to it, potentially non-consecutive, and customizable per primitive.
Each CLAS **can** also have a user-defined 32-bit
[ClusterID](interfaces.html#interfaces-builtin-variables-clusteridnv), which is accessible
in the hit shaders.
The vertex positions within a CLAS **can** be quantized by
[zeroing](#cluster-vertex-position-truncate) specific floating-point
mantissa bits to optimize storage.

Cluster Template Acceleration Structure is a partially constructed
[CLAS](#acceleration-structure-clas-geometry) designed for efficient
instantiation into multiple [CLAS](#acceleration-structure-clas-geometry)
objects.
During a cluster template build, some pre-computation is performed
independent of vertex positions, allowing reuse across multiple CLAS objects
with different vertex data.
A cluster template itself does not require vertex positions but it retains
non-positional properties similar to a CLAS, which are then inherited during
instantiation.
A cluster template **must** be instantiated into a CLAS object to be usable.

Cluster Level Bottom Level Acceleration Structure is a new alternative to
the existing [bottom level acceleration structures](#acceleration-structure-bottom-level), which is constructed using references to already
built [CLAS](#acceleration-structure-clas-geometry) objects and is the only
cluster acceleration structure that **can** be referenced in a top level
acceleration structure.

These cluster acceleration structures **can** be built or moved by a single
versatile multi-indirect function
[vkCmdBuildClusterAccelerationStructureIndirectNV](#vkCmdBuildClusterAccelerationStructureIndirectNV).
To determine the memory requirements for executing this function, call:

// Provided by VK_NV_cluster_acceleration_structure
void vkGetClusterAccelerationStructureBuildSizesNV(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV* pInfo,
    VkAccelerationStructureBuildSizesInfoKHR*   pSizeInfo);

* 
`device` is the logical device that owns the acceleration structure.

* 
`pInfo` is a pointer to a
[VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV) structure containing
parameters required for the memory requirements query.

* 
`pSizeInfo` is a pointer to a
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildSizesInfoKHR](resources.html#VkAccelerationStructureBuildSizesInfoKHR) structure which returns
the size required for an acceleration structure and scratch buffer,
given the build parameters.

If [VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV)::`opMode` is
`VK_CLUSTER_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_OP_MODE_IMPLICIT_DESTINATIONS_NV`,
acceleration structure and scratch memory sizes are returned for all
[VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV)::`maxAccelerationStructureCount`
acceleration structures.
If [VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV)::`opMode` is
`VK_CLUSTER_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_OP_MODE_EXPLICIT_DESTINATIONS_NV`,
scratch memory size for all
[VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV)::`maxAccelerationStructureCount`
acceleration structures and the acceleration structure memory size for a
single acceleration structure is returned.
If [VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV)::`opMode` is
`VK_CLUSTER_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_OP_MODE_COMPUTE_SIZES_NV`, only
scratch memory size is returned for the requested acceleration structures.

* 
`srcInfosArray` is a [VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR](resources.html#VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR) where
input data for the build or move operation is read from.
If the stride is `0`, the structures are assumed to be packed tightly.
Its format is dependent on
[VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureInputInfoNV)::`opType` as per the

`srcInfosCount` is the device address of memory containing the count
of number of build or move operations to perform.
The actual value is the minimum of this value and the value specified in
`input.maxAccelerationStructureCount`.
If this value is `0`, the count is determined by
`input.maxAccelerationStructureCount` alone.

* 
`addressResolutionFlags` is a bitmask of
[VkClusterAccelerationStructureAddressResolutionFlagBitsNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureAddressResolutionFlagBitsNV) values
specifying how an implementation will interpret the device addresses in

* 
`clusterID` is a user specified identifier assigned to this cluster
template.

*

[VkClusterAccelerationStructureClusterFlagBitsNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureClusterFlagBitsNV) values describing
flags how the cluster template should be built.

* 
`triangleCount` is the number of triangles in this cluster.

* 
`vertexCount` is the number of unique vertices in this cluster.

* 
`positionTruncateBitCount` is the number of bits starting at the
lowest bit (i.e. the LSBs of the mantissa), of each vertex position that
will be truncated to zero to improve floating-point compression.

* 
`indexType` is a single
[VkClusterAccelerationStructureIndexFormatFlagBitsNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureIndexFormatFlagBitsNV) value
specifying the index type in `indexBuffer`.

* 
`opacityMicromapIndexType` is a single
[VkClusterAccelerationStructureIndexFormatFlagBitsNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureIndexFormatFlagBitsNV) value
specifying the index type in `opacityMicromapIndexBuffer`.

* 
`baseGeometryIndexAndGeometryFlags` is a
[VkClusterAccelerationStructureGeometryIndexAndGeometryFlagsNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureGeometryIndexAndGeometryFlagsNV)
value specifying the base geometry index and flags for all triangles in
the cluster template.

* 
`indexBufferStride` is the stride in bytes in `indexBuffer`.

* 
`vertexBufferStride` is the stride in bytes in `vertexBuffer`.

* 
`geometryIndexAndFlagsBufferStride` is the stride in bytes in
`geometryIndexAndFlagsBuffer`.

* 
`opacityMicromapIndexBufferStride` is the stride in bytes in

* 
`indexBuffer` contains the indices of vertices in the cluster and is
of type `indexType`.

* 
`vertexBuffer` is either `0` or specifies the vertex data of the
triangles in the cluster template with format specified in
[VkClusterAccelerationStructureTriangleClusterInputNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureTriangleClusterInputNV)::`vertexFormat`.

* 
`geometryIndexAndFlagsBuffer` is either `0` or an address containing
strided
[VkClusterAccelerationStructureGeometryIndexAndGeometryFlagsNV](#VkClusterAccelerationStructureGeometryIndexAndGeometryFlagsNV)
values specifying the geometry index and flag for every triangle in the
cluster.

* 
`opacityMicromapArray` is either `0` or specifies the address of a
valid opacity micromap array to reference from the cluster acceleration
structure.
If it is `0`, then opacity micromaps will be disabled for this cluster
acceleration structure.

* 
`opacityMicromapIndexBuffer` is either `0` or specifies the address
of a strided array with size equal to the number of triangles or indices
into the opacity micromap array.
If `opacityMicromapIndexBuffer` is `0` then the index used is the
index of the triangle in the geometry.

* 
`instantiationBoundingBoxLimit` is either `0` or specifies the
address of a bounding box within which all instantiated clusters **must**
lie.
The bounding box is specified by six 32-bit floating-point values in the
order MinX, MinY, MinZ, MaxX, MaxY, MaxZ.

The C language specification does not define the ordering of bit-fields, but
in practice, this structure produces the correct layout with existing
compilers.
The intended bit pattern is the following:

* 
`triangleCount`, `vertexCount`, `positionTruncateBitCount`,
`indexType` and `opacityMicromapIndexType` occupy the same
memory as if a single `uint32_t` was specified in their place

`triangleCount` occupies the 9 least significant bits of that
memory

* 
`vertexCount` occupies the next 9 least significant bits of that
memory

* 
`positionTruncateBitCount` occupies the next 6 least significant
bits of that memory

* 
`indexType` occupies the next 4 least significant bits of that
memory

* 
`opacityMicromapIndexType` occupies the 4 most significant bits of
that memory

If a compiler produces code that diverges from that pattern, applications
**must** employ another method to set values according to the correct bit
pattern.

Cluster templates cannot be directly used to build bottom level acceleration
structures, instead, they **must** be instantiated into
[CLAS objects](#acceleration-structure-clas-geometry).

Partitioned Top Level Acceleration Structures (PTLAS) allow efficient reuse
of previously constructed sections of the top level acceleration structure
by eliminating a full rebuild when only a few instances are modified.
This reduces build times and supports handling a higher number of instances,
making it more suitable for large and complex scenes.

PTLAS organizes instances into partitions, enabling a two-stage build
process: first, it constructs an acceleration structure for each partition
by grouping the instances within it, and second, it combines these partition
structures into a single acceleration structure, similar to the current
top-level acceleration structure.

To maintain compatibility, PTLAS behaves identically to the current
top-level acceleration structure from the perspective of ray tracing shaders
and pipelines.

PTLAS includes a unique global partition that operates independently of
other partitions.
Instances **can** be assigned to this global partition just like they would to
regular partitions.
The global partition is well-suited for frequently updated instances, such
as animated characters.
During the build process, instances in the global partition are treated as
if they belong to individual partitions, without increasing the maximum
partition count.
However, instances in the global partition may still impact build
performance.
Once these instances become stable, they should be moved to a spatially
optimized, non-global partition to lower build costs and minimize trace
performance issues.

To handle large worlds requiring more precision than 32-bit floating-point
numbers offer, PTLAS offers efficient partition translation.
Typically, applications maintain precision by placing the world center near
the camera.
Partition translation allows an additional translation of instances during
construction without changing their stored transforms.
This method stores instance transforms relative to partitions, applying a
translation to achieve accurate world positions.
Higher precision is maintained using smaller floating-point numbers until
the structure is built.
World space coordinates **can** also be updated efficiently without rebuilding
the entire PTLAS.
Partition translation requires extra memory for untranslated instance
transforms and **must** be explicitly enabled with
[VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureFlagsNV](#VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureFlagsNV)::`enablePartitionTranslation`
flag.

// Provided by VK_NV_partitioned_acceleration_structure

// Provided by VK_NV_partitioned_acceleration_structure
typedef VkFlags VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureInstanceFlagsNV;

`VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureInstanceFlagsNV` is a bitmask type
for setting a mask of zero or more
[VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureInstanceFlagBitsNV](#VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureInstanceFlagBitsNV).

The [VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureWritePartitionTranslationDataNV](#VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureWritePartitionTranslationDataNV)
structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_NV_partitioned_acceleration_structure
typedef struct VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureWritePartitionTranslationDataNV {
    uint32_t    partitionIndex;
    float       partitionTranslation[3];
} VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureWritePartitionTranslationDataNV;

* 
`partitionIndex` is the index of partition to write.
[Global partition](#ptlas-global-partition) is referred to by
`VK_PARTITIONED_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_PARTITION_INDEX_GLOBAL_NV`.

* 
`partitionTranslation` sets the [    translation vector](#ptlas-partition-translation) for this partition.
When tracing this partition, the contained instances will behave as if
the partition translation was added to the translation component of the
instance transform.
This translation vector is also added to the instances in the partition
that had their bounding box specified.

Valid Usage

* 
[](#VUID-VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureWritePartitionTranslationDataNV-partitionIndex-10574) VUID-VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureWritePartitionTranslationDataNV-partitionIndex-10574

`partitionIndex` **must** be less than
[VkBuildPartitionedAccelerationStructureInfoNV](#VkBuildPartitionedAccelerationStructureInfoNV)::`input.partitionCount`

* 
[](#VUID-VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureWritePartitionTranslationDataNV-enablePartitionTranslation-10575) VUID-VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureWritePartitionTranslationDataNV-enablePartitionTranslation-10575

The partitioned acceleration structure **must** have the
[VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureFlagsNV](#VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureFlagsNV)::`enablePartitionTranslation`
flag set

Implementations are also required to provide host implementations of the
acceleration structure operations if the
[`accelerationStructureHostCommands`](features.html#features-accelerationStructureHostCommands) feature is enabled:

* 
[vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](#vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR) corresponding to
[vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](#vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR)

* 
[vkCopyAccelerationStructureKHR](#vkCopyAccelerationStructureKHR) corresponding to
[vkCmdCopyAccelerationStructureKHR](#vkCmdCopyAccelerationStructureKHR)

* 
[vkCopyAccelerationStructureToMemoryKHR](#vkCopyAccelerationStructureToMemoryKHR) corresponding to
[vkCmdCopyAccelerationStructureToMemoryKHR](#vkCmdCopyAccelerationStructureToMemoryKHR)

* 
[vkCopyMemoryToAccelerationStructureKHR](#vkCopyMemoryToAccelerationStructureKHR) corresponding to
[vkCmdCopyMemoryToAccelerationStructureKHR](#vkCmdCopyMemoryToAccelerationStructureKHR)

* 
[vkWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR](#vkWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR) corresponding to
[vkCmdWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR](#vkCmdWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR)

These commands are functionally equivalent to their device counterparts,
except that they are executed on the host timeline, rather than being
enqueued into command buffers.

All acceleration structures used by the host commands **must** be bound to
host-visible memory, and all input data for acceleration structure builds
**must** be referenced using host addresses instead of device addresses.
Applications are not required to map acceleration structure memory when
using the host commands.

|  | The [vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](#vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR) and
| --- | --- |
[vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](#vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR) **may** use different algorithms, and
thus are not required to produce identical structures.
The structures produced by these two commands **may** exhibit different memory
footprints or traversal performance, but should strive to be similar where
possible.

Apart from these details, the host and device operations are
interchangeable.
For example, an application **can** use [vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](#vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR)
to build a structure, compact it on the device using
[vkCmdCopyAccelerationStructureKHR](#vkCmdCopyAccelerationStructureKHR), and serialize the result using
[vkCopyAccelerationStructureToMemoryKHR](#vkCopyAccelerationStructureToMemoryKHR). |

|  | For efficient execution, acceleration structures manipulated using these
| --- | --- |
commands should always be bound to host cached memory, as the implementation
may need to repeatedly read and write this memory during the execution of
the command. |

To build acceleration structures on the host, call:

// Provided by VK_KHR_acceleration_structure
VkResult vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkDeferredOperationKHR                      deferredOperation,
    uint32_t                                    infoCount,
    const VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR* pInfos,
    const VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR* const* ppBuildRangeInfos);

* 
`device` is the `VkDevice` for which the acceleration structures
are being built.

* 
`deferredOperation` is an optional [VkDeferredOperationKHR](VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations/deferred_host_operations.html#VkDeferredOperationKHR) to
[request deferral](VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations/deferred_host_operations.html#deferred-host-operations-requesting) for this
command.

* 
`infoCount` is the number of acceleration structures to build.
It specifies the number of the `pInfos` structures and
`ppBuildRangeInfos` pointers that **must** be provided.

* 
`pInfos` is a pointer to an array of `infoCount`
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR) structures defining
the geometry used to build each acceleration structure.

* 
`ppBuildRangeInfos` is a pointer to an array of `infoCount`
pointers to arrays of [VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR)
structures.
Each `ppBuildRangeInfos`[i] is a pointer to an array of
`pInfos`[i].`geometryCount`
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR](#VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR) structures defining
dynamic offsets to the addresses where geometry data is stored, as
defined by `pInfos`[i].

This command fulfills the same task as
[vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](#vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR) but is executed by the host.

The `vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR` command provides the ability to
initiate multiple acceleration structures builds, however there is no
ordering or synchronization implied between any of the individual
acceleration structure builds.

|  | This means that an application **cannot** build a top-level acceleration
| --- | --- |
structure in the same [vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](#vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR) call as the
associated bottom-level or instance acceleration structures are being built.
There also **cannot** be any memory aliasing between any acceleration structure
memories or scratch memories being used by any of the builds. |
