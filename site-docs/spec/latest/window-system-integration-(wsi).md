## Content

This chapter discusses the window system integration (WSI) between the Vulkan API and the various forms of displaying the results of rendering to a user. Since the Vulkan API can be used without displaying results, WSI is provided through the use of optional Vulkan extensions. This chapter provides an overview of WSI. See the appendix for additional details of each WSI extension, including which extensions must be enabled in order to use each of the functions described in this chapter. A platform is an abstraction for a window system, OS, etc. Some examples include MS Windows, Android, and Wayland. The Vulkan API may be integrated in a unique manner for each platform. The Vulkan API does not define any type of platform object. Platform-specific WSI extensions are defined, each containing platform-specific functions for using WSI. Use of these extensions is guarded by preprocessor symbols as defined in the Window System-Specific Header Control appendix. In order for an application to be compiled to use WSI with a given platform, it must either: #define the appropriate preprocessor symbol prior to including the vulkan.h header file, or include vulkan_core.h and any native platform headers, followed by the appropriate platform-specific header. The preprocessor symbols and platform-specific headers are defined in the Window System Extensions and Headers table. Each platform-specific extension is an instance extension. The application must enable instance extensions with vkCreateInstance before using them. Native platform surface or window objects are abstracted by surface objects, which are represented by VkSurfaceKHR handles: // Provided by VK_KHR_surface VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkSurfaceKHR) The VK_KHR_surface extension declares the VkSurfaceKHR object, and provides a function for destroying VkSurfaceKHR objects. Separate platform-specific extensions each provide a function for creating a VkSurfaceKHR object for the respective platform. From the application’s perspective this is an opaque handle, just like the handles of other Vulkan objects. To create a VkSurfaceKHR object for an Android native window, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_android_surface VkResult vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR( VkInstance instance, const VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR* pCreateInfo, const VkAllocationCallbacks* pAllocator, VkSurfaceKHR* pSurface); instance is the instance to associate the surface with. pCreateInfo is a pointer to a VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing parameters affecting the creation of the surface object. pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see Memory Allocation). pSurface is a pointer to a VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the created surface object is returned. During the lifetime of a surface created using a particular ANativeWindow handle any attempts to create another surface for the same ANativeWindow and any attempts to connect to the same ANativeWindow through other platform mechanisms will fail. In particular, only one VkSurfaceKHR can exist at a time for a given window. Similarly, a native window cannot be used by both a VkSurfaceKHR and EGLSurface simultaneously. If successful, vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR increments the ANativeWindow’s reference count, and vkDestroySurfaceKHR will decrement it. On Android, when a swapchain’s imageExtent does not match the surface’s currentExtent, the presentable images will be scaled to the surface’s dimensions during presentation. minImageExtent is (1,1), and maxImageExtent is the maximum image size supported by the consumer. For the system compositor, currentExtent is the window size (i.e. the consumer’s preferred size). Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR-instance-parameter instance must be a valid VkInstance handle VUID-vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR-pCreateInfo-parameter pCreateInfo must be a valid pointer to a valid VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure VUID-vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR-pAllocator-parameter If pAllocator is not NULL, pAllocator must be a valid pointer to a valid VkAllocationCallbacks structure VUID-vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR-pSurface-parameter pSurface must be a valid pointer to a VkSurfaceKHR handle Return Codes Success VK_SUCCESS Failure VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY VK_ERROR_NATIVE_WINDOW_IN_USE_KHR The VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_KHR_android_surface typedef struct VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; VkAndroidSurfaceCreateFlagsKHR flags; struct ANativeWindow* window; } VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. flags is reserved for future use. window is a pointer to the ANativeWindow to associate the surface with. Valid Usage VUID-VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR-window-01248 window must point to a valid Android ANativeWindow Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR-sType-sType sType must be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ANDROID_SURFACE_CREATE_INFO_KHR VUID-VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR-pNext-pNext pNext must be NULL VUID-VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR-flags-zerobitmask flags must be 0 To remove an unnecessary compile time dependency, an incomplete type definition of ANativeWindow is provided in the Vulkan headers: // Provided by VK_KHR_android_surface struct ANativeWindow; The actual ANativeWindow type is defined in Android NDK headers. // Provided by VK_KHR_android_surface typedef VkFlags VkAndroidSurfaceCreateFlagsKHR; VkAndroidSurfaceCreateFlagsKHR is a bitmask type for setting a mask, but is currently reserved for future use. To create a VkSurfaceKHR object for a Wayland surface, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_wayland_surface VkResult vkCreateWaylandSurfaceKHR( VkInstance instance, const VkWaylandSurfaceCreateInfoKHR* pCreateInfo, const VkAllocationCallbacks* pAllocator, VkSurfaceKHR* pSurface); instance is the instance to associate the surface with. pCreateInfo is a pointer to a VkWaylandSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing parameters affecting the creation of the surface object. pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see Memory Allocation). pSurface is a pointer to a VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the created surface object is returned. Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-vkCreateWaylandSurfaceKHR-instance-parameter instance must be a valid VkInstance handle VUID-vkCreateWaylandSurfaceKHR-pCreateInfo-parameter pCreateInfo must be a valid pointer to a valid VkWaylandSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure VUID-vkCreateWaylandSurfaceKHR-pAllocator-parameter If pAllocator is not NULL, pAllocator must be a valid pointer to a valid VkAllocationCallbacks structure VUID-vkCreateWaylandSurfaceKHR-pSurface-parameter pSurface must be a valid pointer to a VkSurfaceKHR handle Return Codes Success VK_SUCCESS Failure VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY The VkWaylandSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_KHR_wayland_surface typedef struct VkWaylandSurfaceCreateInfoKHR { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; VkWaylandSurfaceCreateFlagsKHR flags; struct wl_display* display; struct wl_surface* surface; } VkWaylandSurfaceCreateInfoKHR; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. flags is reserved for future use. display and surface are pointers to the Wayland wl_display and wl_surface to associate the surface with. Valid Usage VUID-VkWaylandSurfaceCreateInfoKHR-display-01304 display must point to a valid Wayland wl_display VUID-VkWaylandSurfaceCreateInfoKHR-surface-01305 surface must point to a valid Wayland wl_surface Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-VkWaylandSurfaceCreateInfoKHR-sType-sType sType must be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_WAYLAND_SURFACE_CREATE_INFO_KHR VUID-VkWaylandSurfaceCreateInfoKHR-pNext-pNext pNext must be NULL VUID-VkWaylandSurfaceCreateInfoKHR-flags-zerobitmask flags must be 0 On Wayland, currentExtent is the special value (0xFFFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF), indicating that the surface size will be determined by the extent of a swapchain targeting the surface. Whatever the application sets a swapchain’s imageExtent to will be the size of the window, after the first image is presented. minImageExtent is (1,1), and maxImageExtent is the maximum supported surface size. Any calls to vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR on a surface created with vkCreateWaylandSurfaceKHR are required to return VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR as one of the valid present modes. Some Vulkan functions may send protocol over the specified wl_display connection when using a swapchain or presentable images created from a VkSurfaceKHR referring to a wl_surface. Applications must therefore ensure that both the wl_display and the wl_surface remain valid for the lifetime of any VkSwapchainKHR objects created from a particular wl_display and wl_surface. Also, calling vkQueuePresentKHR will result in Vulkan sending wl_surface.commit requests to the underlying wl_surface of each The wl_surface.attach, wl_surface.damage, and wl_surface.commit requests must be issued by the implementation during the call to vkQueuePresentKHR and must not be issued by the implementation outside of vkQueuePresentKHR. This ensures that any Wayland requests sent by the client after the call to vkQueuePresentKHR returns will be received by the compositor after the wl_surface.commit. Regardless of the mode of swapchain creation, a new wl_event_queue must be created for each successful vkCreateWaylandSurfaceKHR call, and every Wayland object created by the implementation must be assigned to this event queue. If the platform provides Wayland 1.11 or greater, this must be implemented by the use of Wayland proxy object wrappers, to avoid race conditions. If the application wishes to synchronize any window changes with a particular frame, such requests must be sent to the Wayland display server prior to calling vkQueuePresentKHR. // Provided by VK_KHR_wayland_surface typedef VkFlags VkWaylandSurfaceCreateFlagsKHR; VkWaylandSurfaceCreateFlagsKHR is a bitmask type for setting a mask, but is currently reserved for future use. To create a VkSurfaceKHR object for a Win32 window, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_win32_surface VkResult vkCreateWin32SurfaceKHR( VkInstance instance, const VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR* pCreateInfo, const VkAllocationCallbacks* pAllocator, VkSurfaceKHR* pSurface); instance is the instance to associate the surface with. pCreateInfo is a pointer to a VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing parameters affecting the creation of the surface object. pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see Memory Allocation). pSurface is a pointer to a VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the created surface object is returned. Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-vkCreateWin32SurfaceKHR-instance-parameter instance must be a valid VkInstance handle VUID-vkCreateWin32SurfaceKHR-pCreateInfo-parameter pCreateInfo must be a valid pointer to a valid VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure VUID-vkCreateWin32SurfaceKHR-pAllocator-parameter If pAllocator is not NULL, pAllocator must be a valid pointer to a valid VkAllocationCallbacks structure VUID-vkCreateWin32SurfaceKHR-pSurface-parameter pSurface must be a valid pointer to a VkSurfaceKHR handle Return Codes Success VK_SUCCESS Failure VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY Some Vulkan functions may call the SendMessage system API when interacting with a VkSurfaceKHR through a VkSwapchainKHR. In a multithreaded environment, calling SendMessage from a thread that is not the thread associated with pCreateInfo->hwnd will block until the application has processed the window message. Thus, applications should either call these Vulkan functions on the message pump thread, or make sure their message pump is actively running. Failing to do so may result in deadlocks. The functions subject to this requirement are: vkCreateSwapchainKHR vkDestroySwapchainKHR vkAcquireNextImageKHR and vkAcquireNextImage2KHR vkQueuePresentKHR vkReleaseSwapchainImagesEXT vkAcquireFullScreenExclusiveModeEXT vkReleaseFullScreenExclusiveModeEXT vkSetHdrMetadataEXT The VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_KHR_win32_surface typedef struct VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; VkWin32SurfaceCreateFlagsKHR flags; HINSTANCE hinstance; HWND hwnd; } VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. flags is reserved for future use. hinstance is the Win32 HINSTANCE for the window to associate the surface with. hwnd is the Win32 HWND for the window to associate the surface with. Valid Usage VUID-VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR-hinstance-01307 hinstance must be a valid Win32 HINSTANCE VUID-VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR-hwnd-01308 hwnd must be a valid Win32 HWND Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR-sType-sType sType must be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_WIN32_SURFACE_CREATE_INFO_KHR VUID-VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR-pNext-pNext pNext must be NULL VUID-VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR-flags-zerobitmask flags must be 0 With Win32, minImageExtent, maxImageExtent, and currentExtent must always equal the window size. The currentExtent of a Win32 surface must have both width and height greater than 0, or both of them 0. Due to above restrictions, unless VkSwapchainPresentScalingCreateInfoEXT is used to specify handling of disparities between surface and swapchain dimensions, it is only possible to create a new swapchain on this platform with imageExtent being equal to the current size of the window, as reported in VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR::currentExtent. The window size may become (0, 0) on this platform (e.g. when the window is minimized), and so a swapchain cannot be created until the size changes. // Provided by VK_KHR_win32_surface typedef VkFlags VkWin32SurfaceCreateFlagsKHR; VkWin32SurfaceCreateFlagsKHR is a bitmask type for setting a mask, but is currently reserved for future use. To create a VkSurfaceKHR object for an X11 window, using the XCB client-side library, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_xcb_surface VkResult vkCreateXcbSurfaceKHR( VkInstance instance, const VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR* pCreateInfo, const VkAllocationCallbacks* pAllocator, VkSurfaceKHR* pSurface); instance is the instance to associate the surface with. pCreateInfo is a pointer to a VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing parameters affecting the creation of the surface object. pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see Memory Allocation). pSurface is a pointer to a VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the created surface object is returned. Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-vkCreateXcbSurfaceKHR-instance-parameter instance must be a valid VkInstance handle VUID-vkCreateXcbSurfaceKHR-pCreateInfo-parameter pCreateInfo must be a valid pointer to a valid VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure VUID-vkCreateXcbSurfaceKHR-pAllocator-parameter If pAllocator is not NULL, pAllocator must be a valid pointer to a valid VkAllocationCallbacks structure VUID-vkCreateXcbSurfaceKHR-pSurface-parameter pSurface must be a valid pointer to a VkSurfaceKHR handle Return Codes Success VK_SUCCESS Failure VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY The VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_KHR_xcb_surface typedef struct VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; VkXcbSurfaceCreateFlagsKHR flags; xcb_connection_t* connection; xcb_window_t window; } VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. flags is reserved for future use. connection is a pointer to an xcb_connection_t to the X server. window is the xcb_window_t for the X11 window to associate the surface with.

The currentExtent of an Xcb surface must have both width and height greater than 0, or both of them 0. Due to above restrictions, unless VkSwapchainPresentScalingCreateInfoEXT is used to specify handling of disparities between surface and swapchain dimensions, it is only possible to create a new swapchain on this platform with imageExtent being equal to the current size of the window, as reported in VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR::currentExtent. The window size may become (0, 0) on this platform (e.g. when the window is minimized), and so a swapchain cannot be created until the size changes. Some Vulkan functions may send protocol over the specified xcb connection when using a swapchain or presentable images created from a VkSurfaceKHR referring to an xcb window. Applications must therefore ensure the xcb connection is available to Vulkan for the duration of any functions that manipulate such swapchains or their presentable images, and any functions that build or queue command buffers that operate on such presentable images. Specifically, applications using Vulkan with xcb-based swapchains must Avoid holding a server grab on an xcb connection while waiting for Vulkan operations to complete using a swapchain derived from a different xcb connection referring to the same X server instance. Failing to do so may result in deadlock. // Provided by VK_KHR_xcb_surface typedef VkFlags VkXcbSurfaceCreateFlagsKHR; VkXcbSurfaceCreateFlagsKHR is a bitmask type for setting a mask, but is currently reserved for future use. To create a VkSurfaceKHR object for an X11 window, using the Xlib client-side library, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_xlib_surface VkResult vkCreateXlibSurfaceKHR( VkInstance instance, const VkXlibSurfaceCreateInfoKHR* pCreateInfo, const VkAllocationCallbacks* pAllocator, VkSurfaceKHR* pSurface); instance is the instance to associate the surface with. pCreateInfo is a pointer to a VkXlibSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing the parameters affecting the creation of the surface object. pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see Memory Allocation). pSurface is a pointer to a VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the created surface object is returned.

Failing to do so may result in deadlock. Some implementations may require threads to implement some presentation modes so applications must call XInitThreads() before calling any other Xlib functions. // Provided by VK_KHR_xlib_surface typedef VkFlags VkXlibSurfaceCreateFlagsKHR; VkXlibSurfaceCreateFlagsKHR is a bitmask type for setting a mask, but is currently reserved for future use.

The minImageExtent will never be greater than 1080p and the maxImageExtent will never be less than 1080p. The currentExtent will reflect the current optimal resolution. Applications are expected to choose an appropriate size for the swapchain’s imageExtent, within the bounds of the surface. Using the surface’s currentExtent will offer the best performance and quality. When a swapchain’s imageExtent does not match the surface’s currentExtent, the presentable images are scaled to the surface’s dimensions during presentation if possible and VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR is returned, otherwise presentation fails with VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR. // Provided by VK_GGP_stream_descriptor_surface typedef VkFlags VkStreamDescriptorSurfaceCreateFlagsGGP; VkStreamDescriptorSurfaceCreateFlagsGGP is a bitmask type for setting a mask, but is currently reserved for future use.

Once created, VkSurfaceKHR objects can be used in this and other extensions, in particular the VK_KHR_swapchain extension. Several WSI functions return VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR if the surface becomes no longer available. After such an error, the surface (and any child swapchain, if one exists) should be destroyed, as there is no way to restore them to a not-lost state. Applications may attempt to create a new VkSurfaceKHR using the same native platform window object, but whether such re-creation will succeed is platform-dependent and may depend on the reason the surface became unavailable. A lost surface does not otherwise cause devices to be lost. To destroy a VkSurfaceKHR object, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_surface void vkDestroySurfaceKHR( VkInstance instance, VkSurfaceKHR surface, const VkAllocationCallbacks* pAllocator); instance is the instance used to create the surface. surface is the surface to destroy. pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see Memory Allocation). Destroying a VkSurfaceKHR merely severs the connection between Vulkan and the native surface, and does not imply destroying the native surface, closing a window, or similar behavior.

This can be useful for embedded applications, or implementing the rendering/presentation backend of a windowing system using Vulkan. The VK_KHR_display extension provides the functionality necessary to enumerate display devices and create VkSurfaceKHR objects that target displays. Displays are represented by VkDisplayKHR handles: // Provided by VK_KHR_display VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkDisplayKHR) Various functions are provided for enumerating the available display devices present on a Vulkan physical device. To query information about the available displays, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_display VkResult vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayPropertiesKHR( VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice, uint32_t* pPropertyCount, VkDisplayPropertiesKHR* pProperties); physicalDevice is a physical device. pPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of display devices available or queried, as described below. pProperties is either NULL or a pointer to an array of VkDisplayPropertiesKHR structures. If pProperties is NULL, then the number of display devices available for physicalDevice is returned in pPropertyCount. Otherwise, pPropertyCount must point to a variable set by the application to the number of elements in the pProperties array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually written to pProperties. If the value of pPropertyCount is less than the number of display devices for physicalDevice, at most pPropertyCount structures will be written, and VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of VK_SUCCESS, to indicate that not all the available properties were returned.

This handle will be valid for the lifetime of the Vulkan instance. displayName is NULL or a pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string containing the name of the display. Generally, this will be the name provided by the display’s EDID. If NULL, no suitable name is available. If not NULL, the string pointed to must remain accessible and unmodified as long as display is valid. physicalDimensions describes the physical width and height of the visible portion of the display, in millimeters. physicalResolution describes the physical, native, or preferred resolution of the display. For devices which have no natural value to return here, implementations should return the maximum resolution supported. supportedTransforms is a bitmask of VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR describing which transforms are supported by this display. planeReorderPossible tells whether the planes on this display can have their z order changed. If this is VK_TRUE, the application can re-arrange the planes on this display in any order relative to each other. persistentContent tells whether the display supports self-refresh/internal buffering. If this is true, the application can submit persistent present operations on swapchains created against this display. Persistent presents may have higher latency, and may use less power when the screen content is updated infrequently, or when only a portion of the screen needs to be updated in most frames. To query information about the available displays, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_get_display_properties2 VkResult vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayProperties2KHR( VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice, uint32_t* pPropertyCount, VkDisplayProperties2KHR* pProperties); physicalDevice is a physical device. pPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of display devices available or queried, as described below. pProperties is either NULL or a pointer to an array of VkDisplayProperties2KHR structures. vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayProperties2KHR behaves similarly to vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayPropertiesKHR, with the ability to return extended information via chained output structures.

All permissions necessary to control the display are granted to the Vulkan instance associated with physicalDevice until the display is released or the X11 connection specified by dpy is terminated. Permission to access the display may be temporarily revoked during periods when the X11 server from which control was acquired itself loses access to display. During such periods, operations which require access to the display must fail with an appropriate error code. If the X11 server associated with dpy does not own display, or if permission to access it has already been acquired by another entity, the call must return the error code VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED.

All permissions necessary to control the display are granted to the Vulkan instance associated with physicalDevice until the display is released or the application is terminated. Permission to access the display may be revoked by events that cause Windows 10 itself to lose access to display. If this has happened, operations which require access to the display must fail with an appropriate error code. If permission to access display has already been acquired by another entity, the call must return the error code VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED. The Vulkan instance acquires control of a “winrt::Windows::Devices::Display::Core::DisplayTarget” by performing an operation equivalent to “winrt::Windows::Devices::Display::Core::DisplayManager.TryAcquireTarget()” on the “DisplayTarget”. One example of when Windows 10 loses access to a display is when the display is hot-unplugged. One example of when a display has already been acquired by another entity is when the Windows desktop compositor (DWM) is in control of the display. Beginning with Windows 10 version 2004 it is possible to cause DWM to release a display by using the “Advanced display settings” sub-page of the “Display settings” control panel. vkAcquireWinrtDisplayNV does not itself cause DWM to release a display; this action must be performed outside of Vulkan.

Unlike the *Src* offsets, minDstPosition and maxDstPosition may contain negative values.

Vendors may also support mapping the presentable images’ content to a subset or superset of the visible region in the specified display mode. This is expressed by returning minDstPosition, maxDstPosition, minDstExtent and maxDstExtent values that indicate a range of possible positions and sizes which may be used to describe the region within the display mode that the source pixels will be mapped to.

Vulkan rendering can be presented to a headless surface, where the presentation operation is a no-op producing no externally-visible result.

This makes it a useful portable test target for applications targeting a wide range of presentation engines where the actual target presentation engines might be scarce, unavailable or otherwise undesirable or inconvenient to use for general Vulkan application development. The usual surface query mechanisms must be used to determine the actual restrictions and features of the implementation.

Not all physical devices will include WSI support. Within a physical device, not all queue families will support presentation. WSI support and compatibility can be determined in a platform-neutral manner (which determines support for presentation to a particular surface object) and additionally may be determined in platform-specific manners (which determine support for presentation on the specified physical device but do not guarantee support for presentation to a particular surface object).

The resulting capabilities can be obtained with the queries listed below in this section. In addition to the surface capabilities as obtained by surface queries below, swapchain images are also subject to ordinary image creation limits as reported by vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties. As an application is instructed by the appropriate Valid Usage sections, both the surface capabilities and the image creation limits have to be satisfied whenever swapchain images are created. To query the basic capabilities of a surface, needed in order to create a swapchain, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_surface VkResult vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR( VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice, VkSurfaceKHR surface, VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR* pSurfaceCapabilities); physicalDevice is the physical device that will be associated with the swapchain to be created, as described for vkCreateSwapchainKHR. surface is the surface that will be associated with the swapchain. pSurfaceCapabilities is a pointer to a VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR structure in which the capabilities are returned.

Additional capabilities of a surface may be available to swapchains created with different full-screen exclusive settings - particularly if exclusive full-screen access is application controlled.

VK_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_DISALLOWED_EXT specifies that the implementation should avoid using full-screen mechanisms which rely on disruptive transitions. VK_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_APPLICATION_CONTROLLED_EXT specifies that the application will manage full-screen exclusive mode by using the vkAcquireFullScreenExclusiveModeEXT and vkReleaseFullScreenExclusiveModeEXT commands.

If the VK_GOOGLE_surfaceless_query extension is enabled, the value returned in supportsProtected will be identical for every valid surface created on this physical device, and so in the vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities2KHR call, VkPhysicalDeviceSurfaceInfo2KHR::surface can be VK_NULL_HANDLE.

The per-present mode image counts may be less-than or greater-than the image counts returned when VkSurfacePresentModeEXT is not provided. If VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT is provided to swapchain creation, the requirements for forward progress may be less strict. For example, a FIFO swapchain might only require 2 images to guarantee forward progress, but a MAILBOX one might require 4. Without the per-present image counts, such an implementation would have to return 4 in VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR::minImageCount, which pessimizes FIFO. Conversely, an implementation may return a low number for minImageCount, but internally bump the image count when application queries vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR, which can surprise applications, and is not discoverable until swapchain creation. Using VkSurfacePresentModeEXT and VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT together effectively removes this problem. VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT is required for the specification to be backwards compatible with applications that do not know about, or make use of this feature.

If pPresentModes is NULL, then the number of present modes that are compatible with the one specified in VkSurfacePresentModeEXT is returned in presentModeCount. Otherwise, presentModeCount must point to a variable set by the application to the number of elements in the pPresentModes array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of values actually written to pPresentModes. If the value of presentModeCount is less than the number of compatible present modes that are supported, at most presentModeCount values will be written to pPresentModes. The implementation must include the present mode passed to VkSurfacePresentModeEXT in pPresentModes, unless presentModeCount is zero. Before creating a swapchain whose present modes can be modified through the use of VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT, obtain the set of present modes compatible with a given initial present mode by including a VkSurfacePresentModeEXT structure in the pNext chain of VkPhysicalDeviceSurfaceInfo2KHR when calling vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities2KHR.

VK_COLOR_SPACE_DISPLAY_P3_NONLINEAR_EXT specifies support for the images in Display-P3 color space, encoded using a Display-P3 transfer function. VK_COLOR_SPACE_EXTENDED_SRGB_LINEAR_EXT specifies support for the images in extended sRGB color space, encoded using a linear transfer function.

VK_COLOR_SPACE_PASS_THROUGH_EXT specifies that color components are used “as is”. This is intended to allow applications to supply data for color spaces not described here. VK_COLOR_SPACE_DISPLAY_NATIVE_AMD specifies support for the display’s native color space. This matches the color space expectations of AMD’s FreeSync2 standard, for displays supporting it. In the initial release of the VK_KHR_surface and VK_KHR_swapchain extensions, the token VK_COLORSPACE_SRGB_NONLINEAR_KHR was used. Starting in the 2016-05-13 updates to the extension branches, matching release 1.0.13 of the core API specification, VK_COLOR_SPACE_SRGB_NONLINEAR_KHR is used instead for consistency with Vulkan naming rules. The older enum is still available for backwards compatibility. In older versions of this extension VK_COLOR_SPACE_DISPLAY_P3_LINEAR_EXT was misnamed VK_COLOR_SPACE_DCI_P3_LINEAR_EXT. This has been updated to indicate that it uses RGB color encoding, not XYZ. The old name is deprecated but is maintained for backwards compatibility. In older versions of the VK_EXT_swapchain_colorspace extension, VK_COLOR_SPACE_DOLBYVISION_EXT was exposed. The intent was to indicate the presentation engine shall decode an image using the SMPTE ST 2084 Perceptual Quantizer (PQ) EOTF, and then apply a proprietary OOTF to process the image. However, Dolby Vision profile 8.4 describes an encoding using the Hybrid Log Gamma (HLG) OETF, and there is no swapchain extension for signaling Dolby Vision metadata to be used by a proprietary OOTF. This enum is deprecated but is maintained for backwards compatibility. For a traditional “Linear” or non-gamma transfer function color space use VK_COLOR_SPACE_PASS_THROUGH_EXT. The presentation engine interprets the pixel values of the R, G, and B components as having been encoded using an appropriate transfer function. Applications should ensure that the appropriate transfer function has been applied. Textures Output Format Conversion requires that all implementations implicitly apply the sRGB EOTF-1 on R, G, and B components when shaders write to an sRGB pixel format image, which is useful for sRGB color spaces. For sRGB color spaces with other pixel formats, or other non-linear color spaces, applications can apply the transfer function explicitly in a shader. The A channel is always interpreted as linearly encoded. This extension defines enums for VkColorSpaceKHR that correspond to the following color spaces: Table 1.

Except Display-P3 OETF, which is: where L is the linear value of a color component and E is the encoded value (as stored in the image in memory). For most uses, the sRGB OETF is equivalent. To query the supported presentation modes for a surface, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_surface VkResult vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR( VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice, VkSurfaceKHR surface, uint32_t* pPresentModeCount, VkPresentModeKHR* pPresentModes); physicalDevice is the physical device that will be associated with the swapchain to be created, as described for vkCreateSwapchainKHR. surface is the surface that will be associated with the swapchain. pPresentModeCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of presentation modes available or queried, as described below. pPresentModes is either NULL or a pointer to an array of VkPresentModeKHR values, indicating the supported presentation modes. If pPresentModes is NULL, then the number of presentation modes supported for the given surface is returned in pPresentModeCount. Otherwise, pPresentModeCount must point to a variable set by the application to the number of elements in the pPresentModes array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of values actually written to pPresentModes. If the value of pPresentModeCount is less than the number of presentation modes supported, at most pPresentModeCount values will be written, and VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of VK_SUCCESS, to indicate that not all the available modes were returned. If the VK_GOOGLE_surfaceless_query extension is enabled and surface is VK_NULL_HANDLE, the values returned in pPresentModes will only indicate support for VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR, VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_DEMAND_REFRESH_KHR, and VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_CONTINUOUS_REFRESH_KHR. To query support for any other present mode, a valid handle must be provided in surface.

Valid Usage VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModes2EXT-pSurfaceInfo-06521 If the VK_GOOGLE_surfaceless_query extension is not enabled, pSurfaceInfo->surface must be a valid VkSurfaceKHR handle VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModes2EXT-pSurfaceInfo-06522 If pSurfaceInfo->surface is not VK_NULL_HANDLE, pSurfaceInfo->surface must be supported by physicalDevice, as reported by vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR or an equivalent platform-specific mechanism Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModes2EXT-physicalDevice-parameter physicalDevice must be a valid VkPhysicalDevice handle VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModes2EXT-pSurfaceInfo-parameter pSurfaceInfo must be a valid pointer to a valid VkPhysicalDeviceSurfaceInfo2KHR structure VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModes2EXT-pPresentModeCount-parameter pPresentModeCount must be a valid pointer to a uint32_t value VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModes2EXT-pPresentModes-parameter If the value referenced by pPresentModeCount is not 0, and pPresentModes is not NULL, pPresentModes must be a valid pointer to an array of pPresentModeCount VkPresentModeKHR values Return Codes Success VK_SUCCESS VK_INCOMPLETE Failure VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR Possible values of elements of the vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR::pPresentModes array, indicating the supported presentation modes for a surface, are: // Provided by VK_KHR_surface typedef enum VkPresentModeKHR { VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR = 0, VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR = 1, VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR = 2, VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR = 3, // Provided by VK_KHR_shared_presentable_image VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_DEMAND_REFRESH_KHR = 1000111000, // Provided by VK_KHR_shared_presentable_image VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_CONTINUOUS_REFRESH_KHR = 1000111001, // Provided by VK_EXT_present_mode_fifo_latest_ready VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_LATEST_READY_EXT = 1000361000, } VkPresentModeKHR; VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR specifies that the presentation engine does not wait for a vertical blanking period to update the current image, meaning this mode may result in visible tearing. No internal queuing of presentation requests is needed, as the requests are applied immediately. VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR specifies that the presentation engine waits for the next vertical blanking period to update the current image. Tearing cannot be observed. An internal single-entry queue is used to hold pending presentation requests. If the queue is full when a new presentation request is received, the new request replaces the existing entry, and any images associated with the prior entry become available for reuse by the application. One request is removed from the queue and processed during each vertical blanking period in which the queue is non-empty. VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR specifies that the presentation engine waits for the next vertical blanking period to update the current image. Tearing cannot be observed. An internal queue is used to hold pending presentation requests. New requests are appended to the end of the queue, and one request is removed from the beginning of the queue and processed during each vertical blanking period in which the queue is non-empty. This is the only value of presentMode that is required to be supported. VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR specifies that the presentation engine generally waits for the next vertical blanking period to update the current image. If a vertical blanking period has already passed since the last update of the current image then the presentation engine does not wait for another vertical blanking period for the update, meaning this mode may result in visible tearing in this case. This mode is useful for reducing visual stutter with an application that will mostly present a new image before the next vertical blanking period, but may occasionally be late, and present a new image just after the next vertical blanking period. An internal queue is used to hold pending presentation requests. New requests are appended to the end of the queue, and one request is removed from the beginning of the queue and processed during or after each vertical blanking period in which the queue is non-empty. VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_LATEST_READY_EXT specifies that the presentation engine waits for the next vertical blanking period to update the current image. Tearing cannot be observed. An internal queue is used to hold pending presentation requests. New requests are appended to the end of the queue. At each vertical blanking period, the presentation engine dequeues all successive requests that are ready to be presented from the beginning of the queue. If using VK_GOOGLE_display_timing to provide a target present time, the presentation engine will check the specified time for each image. If the target present time is less-than or equal-to the current time, the presentation engine will dequeue the image and check the next one. The image of the last dequeued request will be presented. The other dequeued requests will be dropped. VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_DEMAND_REFRESH_KHR specifies that the presentation engine and application have concurrent access to a single image, which is referred to as a shared presentable image. The presentation engine is only required to update the current image after a new presentation request is received. Therefore the application must make a presentation request whenever an update is required. However, the presentation engine may update the current image at any point, meaning this mode may result in visible tearing. VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_CONTINUOUS_REFRESH_KHR specifies that the presentation engine and application have concurrent access to a single image, which is referred to as a shared presentable image. The presentation engine periodically updates the current image on its regular refresh cycle. The application is only required to make one initial presentation request, after which the presentation engine must update the current image without any need for further presentation requests. The application can indicate the image contents have been updated by making a presentation request, but this does not guarantee the timing of when it will be updated. This mode may result in visible tearing if rendering to the image is not timed correctly. The supported VkImageUsageFlagBits of the presentable images of a swapchain created for a surface may differ depending on the presentation mode, and can be determined as per the table below: Table 2.

Swapchains created with fullScreenExclusive set to VK_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_APPLICATION_CONTROLLED_EXT must acquire and release exclusive full-screen access explicitly, using the following commands. To acquire exclusive full-screen access for a swapchain, call: // Provided by VK_EXT_full_screen_exclusive VkResult vkAcquireFullScreenExclusiveModeEXT( VkDevice device, VkSwapchainKHR swapchain); device is the device associated with swapchain. swapchain is the swapchain to acquire exclusive full-screen access for. Valid Usage VUID-vkAcquireFullScreenExclusiveModeEXT-swapchain-02674 swapchain must not be in the retired state VUID-vkAcquireFullScreenExclusiveModeEXT-swapchain-02675 swapchain must be a swapchain created with a VkSurfaceFullScreenExclusiveInfoEXT structure, with fullScreenExclusive set to VK_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_APPLICATION_CONTROLLED_EXT VUID-vkAcquireFullScreenExclusiveModeEXT-swapchain-02676 swapchain must not currently have exclusive full-screen access A return value of VK_SUCCESS indicates that the swapchain successfully acquired exclusive full-screen access. The swapchain will retain this exclusivity until either the application releases exclusive full-screen access with vkReleaseFullScreenExclusiveModeEXT, destroys the swapchain, or if any of the swapchain commands return VK_ERROR_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_MODE_LOST_EXT indicating that the mode was lost because of platform-specific changes. If the swapchain was unable to acquire exclusive full-screen access to the display then VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED is returned. An application can attempt to acquire exclusive full-screen access again for the same swapchain even if this command fails, or if VK_ERROR_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_MODE_LOST_EXT has been returned by a swapchain command.

This avoids the visual anomaly known as tearing. However, synchronizing the presentation of images with the RC does not prevent all forms of visual anomalies. Stuttering occurs when the geometry for each presentable image is not accurately positioned for when that image will be displayed. The geometry may appear to move too little some RCs, and too much for others. Sometimes the animation appears to freeze, when the same image is used for more than one RC. In order to minimize stuttering, an application needs to correctly position their geometry for when the presentable image will be displayed to the user. To accomplish this, applications need various timing information about the presentation engine’s display. They need to know when presentable images were actually presented, and when they could have been presented. Applications also need to tell the presentation engine to display an image no sooner than a given time. This can allow the application’s animation to look smooth to the user, with no stuttering. The VK_GOOGLE_display_timing extension allows an application to satisfy these needs. The presentation engine’s display typically refreshes the pixels that are displayed to the user on a periodic basis. The period may be fixed or variable. In many cases, the presentation engine is associated with fixed refresh rate (FRR) display technology, with a fixed refresh rate (RR, e.g. 60Hz). In some cases, the presentation engine is associated with variable refresh rate (VRR) display technology, where each refresh cycle (RC) can vary in length. This extension treats VRR displays as if they are FRR. To query the duration of a refresh cycle (RC) for the presentation engine’s display, call: // Provided by VK_GOOGLE_display_timing VkResult vkGetRefreshCycleDurationGOOGLE( VkDevice device, VkSwapchainKHR swapchain, VkRefreshCycleDurationGOOGLE* pDisplayTimingProperties); device is the device associated with swapchain. swapchain is the swapchain to obtain the refresh duration for. pDisplayTimingProperties is a pointer to a VkRefreshCycleDurationGOOGLE structure.

The rate at which an application renders and presents new images is known as the image present rate (IPR, aka frame rate). The inverse of IPR, or the duration between each image present, is the image present duration (IPD). In order to provide a smooth, stutter-free animation, an application will want its IPD to be a multiple of refreshDuration. For example, if a display has a 60Hz refresh rate, refreshDuration will be a value in nanoseconds that is approximately equal to 16.67ms. In such a case, an application will want an IPD of 16.67ms (1X multiplier of refreshDuration), or 33.33ms (2X multiplier of refreshDuration), or 50.0ms (3X multiplier of refreshDuration), etc. In order to determine a target IPD for a display (i.e. a multiple of refreshDuration), an application needs to determine when its images are actually displayed. Suppose an application has an initial target IPD of 16.67ms (1X multiplier of refreshDuration). It will therefore position the geometry of a new image 16.67ms later than the previous image. But suppose this application is running on slower hardware, so that it actually takes 20ms to render each new image. This will create visual anomalies, because the images will not be displayed to the user every 16.67ms, nor every 20ms. In this case, it is better for the application to adjust its target IPD to 33.33ms (i.e. a 2X multiplier of refreshDuration), and tell the presentation engine to not present images any sooner than every 33.33ms. This will allow the geometry to be correctly positioned for each presentable image. Adjustments to an application’s IPD may be needed because different views of an application’s geometry can take different amounts of time to render. For example, looking at the sky may take less time to render than looking at multiple, complex items in a room. In general, it is good to not frequently change IPD, as that can cause visual anomalies. Adjustments to a larger IPD because of late images should happen quickly, but adjustments to a smaller IPD should only happen if the actualPresentTime and earliestPresentTime members of the VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE structure are consistently different, and if presentMargin is consistently large, over multiple images. The implementation will maintain a limited amount of history of timing information about previous presents. Because of the asynchronous nature of the presentation engine, the timing information for a given vkQueuePresentKHR command will become available some time later. These time values can be asynchronously queried, and will be returned if available. All time values are in nanoseconds, relative to a monotonically-increasing clock (e.g. CLOCK_MONOTONIC (see clock_gettime(2)) on Android and Linux). To asynchronously query the presentation engine, for newly-available timing information about one or more previous presents to a given swapchain, call: // Provided by VK_GOOGLE_display_timing VkResult vkGetPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE( VkDevice device, VkSwapchainKHR swapchain, uint32_t* pPresentationTimingCount, VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE* pPresentationTimings); device is the device associated with swapchain. swapchain is the swapchain to obtain presentation timing information duration for. pPresentationTimingCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE structures to query, as described below. pPresentationTimings is either NULL or a pointer to an array of VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE structures. If pPresentationTimings is NULL, then the number of newly-available timing records for the given swapchain is returned in pPresentationTimingCount. Otherwise, pPresentationTimingCount must point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the pPresentationTimings array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually written to pPresentationTimings. If the value of pPresentationTimingCount is less than the number of newly-available timing records, at most pPresentationTimingCount structures will be written, and VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of VK_SUCCESS, to indicate that not all the available timing records were returned.

It can be used to uniquely identify a previous present with the vkQueuePresentKHR command. desiredPresentTime is an application-provided value that was given to a previous vkQueuePresentKHR command via VkPresentTimeGOOGLE::desiredPresentTime. If non-zero, it was used by the application to indicate that an image not be presented any sooner than desiredPresentTime. actualPresentTime is the time when the image of the swapchain was actually displayed. earliestPresentTime is the time when the image of the swapchain could have been displayed. This may differ from actualPresentTime if the application requested that the image be presented no sooner than VkPresentTimeGOOGLE::desiredPresentTime. presentMargin is an indication of how early the vkQueuePresentKHR command was processed compared to how soon it needed to be processed, and still be presented at earliestPresentTime. The results for a given swapchain and presentID are only returned once from vkGetPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE. The application can use the VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE values to occasionally adjust its timing. For example, if actualPresentTime is later than expected (e.g. one refreshDuration late), the application may increase its target IPD to a higher multiple of refreshDuration (e.g. decrease its frame rate from 60Hz to 30Hz). If actualPresentTime and earliestPresentTime are consistently different, and if presentMargin is consistently large enough, the application may decrease its target IPD to a smaller multiple of refreshDuration (e.g. increase its frame rate from 30Hz to 60Hz). If actualPresentTime and earliestPresentTime are same, and if presentMargin is consistently high, the application may delay the start of its input-render-present loop in order to decrease the latency between user input and the corresponding present (always leaving some margin in case a new image takes longer to render than the previous image). An application that desires its target IPD to always be the same as refreshDuration, can also adjust features until actualPresentTime is never late and presentMargin is satisfactory. The full VK_GOOGLE_display_timing extension semantics are described for swapchains created with VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR. For example, non-zero values of VkPresentTimeGOOGLE::desiredPresentTime must be honored, and vkGetPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE should return a VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE structure with valid values for all images presented with vkQueuePresentKHR. The semantics for other present modes are as follows: VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR. The presentation engine may ignore non-zero values of VkPresentTimeGOOGLE::desiredPresentTime in favor of presenting immediately. The value of VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE::earliestPresentTime must be the same as VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE::actualPresentTime, which should be when the presentation engine displayed the image. VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR. The intention of using this present mode with this extension is to handle cases where an image is presented late, and the next image is presented soon enough to replace it at the next vertical blanking period. For images that are displayed to the user, the value of VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE::actualPresentTime must be when the image was displayed. For images that are not displayed to the user, vkGetPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE may not return a VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE structure, or it may return a VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE structure with the value of zero for both VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE::actualPresentTime and VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE::earliestPresentTime. It is possible that an application can submit images with VkPresentTimeGOOGLE::desiredPresentTime values such that new images may not be displayed. For example, if VkPresentTimeGOOGLE::desiredPresentTime is far enough in the future that an image is not presented before vkQueuePresentKHR is called to present another image, the first image will not be displayed to the user. If the application continues to do that, the presentation may not display new images. VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR. For images that are presented in time to be displayed at the next vertical blanking period, the semantics are identical as for VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR. For images that are presented late, and are displayed after the start of the vertical blanking period (i.e. with tearing), the values of VkPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE may be treated as if the image was displayed at the start of the vertical blanking period, or may be treated the same as for VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR. Applications wanting to control the pacing of the application by monitoring when presentation processes have completed to limit the number of outstanding images queued for presentation, need to have a method of being signaled during the presentation process. Using the VK_GOOGLE_display_timing extension applications can discover when images were presented, but only asynchronously. Providing a mechanism which allows applications to block, waiting for a specific step of the presentation process to complete allows them to control the amount of outstanding work (and hence the potential lag in responding to user input or changes in the rendering environment). The VK_KHR_present_wait extension allows applications to tell the presentation engine at the vkQueuePresentKHR call that it plans on waiting for presentation by passing a VkPresentIdKHR structure. The presentId passed in that structure may then be passed to a future vkWaitForPresentKHR call to cause the application to block until that presentation is finished. A swapchain object (a.k.a. swapchain) provides the ability to present rendering results to a surface. Swapchain objects are represented by VkSwapchainKHR handles: // Provided by VK_KHR_swapchain VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkSwapchainKHR) A swapchain is an abstraction for an array of presentable images that are associated with a surface. The presentable images are represented by VkImage objects created by the platform. One image (which can be an array image for multiview/stereoscopic-3D surfaces) is displayed at a time, but multiple images can be queued for presentation. An application renders to the image, and then queues the image for presentation to the surface. A native window cannot be associated with more than one non-retired swapchain at a time. Further, swapchains cannot be created for native windows that have a non-Vulkan graphics API surface associated with them. The presentation engine is an abstraction for the platform’s compositor or display engine. The presentation engine may be synchronous or asynchronous with respect to the application and/or logical device. Some implementations may use the device’s graphics queue or dedicated presentation hardware to perform presentation. The presentable images of a swapchain are owned by the presentation engine. An application can acquire use of a presentable image from the presentation engine. Use of a presentable image must occur only after the image is returned by vkAcquireNextImageKHR, and before it is released by vkQueuePresentKHR. This includes transitioning the image layout and rendering commands. An application can acquire use of a presentable image with vkAcquireNextImageKHR. After acquiring a presentable image and before modifying it, the application must use a synchronization primitive to ensure that the presentation engine has finished reading from the image. The application can then transition the image’s layout, queue rendering commands to it, etc. Finally, the application presents the image with vkQueuePresentKHR, which releases the acquisition of the image. The application can also release the acquisition of the image through vkReleaseSwapchainImagesEXT, if the image is not in use by the device, and skip the present operation. The presentation engine controls the order in which presentable images are acquired for use by the application. This allows the platform to handle situations which require out-of-order return of images after presentation. At the same time, it allows the application to generate command buffers referencing all of the images in the swapchain at initialization time, rather than in its main loop. How this all works is described below. If a swapchain is created with presentMode set to either VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_DEMAND_REFRESH_KHR or VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_CONTINUOUS_REFRESH_KHR, a single presentable image can be acquired, referred to as a shared presentable image. A shared presentable image may be concurrently accessed by the application and the presentation engine, without transitioning the image’s layout after it is initially presented. With VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_DEMAND_REFRESH_KHR, the presentation engine is only required to update to the latest contents of a shared presentable image after a present. The application must call vkQueuePresentKHR to guarantee an update. However, the presentation engine may update from it at any time. With VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_CONTINUOUS_REFRESH_KHR, the presentation engine will automatically present the latest contents of a shared presentable image during every refresh cycle. The application is only required to make one initial call to vkQueuePresentKHR, after which the presentation engine will update from it without any need for further present calls. The application can indicate the image contents have been updated by calling vkQueuePresentKHR, but this does not guarantee the timing of when updates will occur. The presentation engine may access a shared presentable image at any time after it is first presented. To avoid tearing, an application should coordinate access with the presentation engine. This requires presentation engine timing information through platform-specific mechanisms and ensuring that color attachment writes are made available during the portion of the presentation engine’s refresh cycle they are intended for. The VK_KHR_shared_presentable_image extension does not provide functionality for determining the timing of the presentation engine’s refresh cycles. In order to query a swapchain’s status when rendering to a shared presentable image, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_shared_presentable_image VkResult vkGetSwapchainStatusKHR( VkDevice device, VkSwapchainKHR swapchain); device is the device associated with swapchain. swapchain is the swapchain to query. Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-vkGetSwapchainStatusKHR-device-parameter device must be a valid VkDevice handle VUID-vkGetSwapchainStatusKHR-swapchain-parameter swapchain must be a valid VkSwapchainKHR handle VUID-vkGetSwapchainStatusKHR-swapchain-parent swapchain must have been created, allocated, or retrieved from device Host Synchronization Host access to swapchain must be externally synchronized Return Codes Success VK_SUCCESS VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR Failure VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR VK_ERROR_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_MODE_LOST_EXT The possible return values for vkGetSwapchainStatusKHR should be interpreted as follows: VK_SUCCESS specifies the presentation engine is presenting the contents of the shared presentable image, as per the swapchain’s VkPresentModeKHR. VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR the swapchain no longer matches the surface properties exactly, but the presentation engine is presenting the contents of the shared presentable image, as per the swapchain’s VkPresentModeKHR. VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR the surface has changed in such a way that it is no longer compatible with the swapchain. VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR the surface is no longer available. The swapchain state may be cached by implementations, so applications should regularly call vkGetSwapchainStatusKHR when using a swapchain with VkPresentModeKHR equal to VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_CONTINUOUS_REFRESH_KHR. To create a swapchain, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_swapchain VkResult vkCreateSwapchainKHR( VkDevice device, const VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR* pCreateInfo, const VkAllocationCallbacks* pAllocator, VkSwapchainKHR* pSwapchain); device is the device to create the swapchain for. pCreateInfo is a pointer to a VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR structure specifying the parameters of the created swapchain. pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the swapchain object when there is no more specific allocator available (see Memory Allocation). pSwapchain is a pointer to a VkSwapchainKHR handle in which the created swapchain object will be returned. As mentioned above, if vkCreateSwapchainKHR succeeds, it will return a handle to a swapchain containing an array of at least pCreateInfo->minImageCount presentable images. While acquired by the application, presentable images can be used in any way that equivalent non-presentable images can be used. A presentable image is equivalent to a non-presentable image created with the following VkImageCreateInfo parameters: VkImageCreateInfo Field Value flags VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPLIT_INSTANCE_BIND_REGIONS_BIT is set if VK_SWAPCHAIN_CREATE_SPLIT_INSTANCE_BIND_REGIONS_BIT_KHR is set VK_IMAGE_CREATE_PROTECTED_BIT is set if VK_SWAPCHAIN_CREATE_PROTECTED_BIT_KHR is set VK_IMAGE_CREATE_MUTABLE_FORMAT_BIT and VK_IMAGE_CREATE_EXTENDED_USAGE_BIT_KHR are both set if VK_SWAPCHAIN_CREATE_MUTABLE_FORMAT_BIT_KHR is set all other bits are unset imageType VK_IMAGE_TYPE_2D format pCreateInfo->imageFormat extent {pCreateInfo->imageExtent.width, pCreateInfo->imageExtent.height, 1} mipLevels 1 arrayLayers pCreateInfo->imageArrayLayers samples VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT tiling VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL usage pCreateInfo->imageUsage sharingMode pCreateInfo->imageSharingMode queueFamilyIndexCount pCreateInfo->queueFamilyIndexCount pQueueFamilyIndices pCreateInfo->pQueueFamilyIndices initialLayout VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED The pCreateInfo->surface must not be destroyed until after the swapchain is destroyed. If oldSwapchain is VK_NULL_HANDLE, and the native window referred to by pCreateInfo->surface is already associated with a Vulkan swapchain, VK_ERROR_NATIVE_WINDOW_IN_USE_KHR must be returned. If the native window referred to by pCreateInfo->surface is already associated with a non-Vulkan graphics API surface, VK_ERROR_NATIVE_WINDOW_IN_USE_KHR must be returned. The native window referred to by pCreateInfo->surface must not become associated with a non-Vulkan graphics API surface before all associated Vulkan swapchains have been destroyed. vkCreateSwapchainKHR will return VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST if the logical device was lost. The VkSwapchainKHR is a child of the device, and must be destroyed before the device. However, VkSurfaceKHR is not a child of any VkDevice and is not affected by the lost device. After successfully recreating a VkDevice, the same VkSurfaceKHR can be used to create a new VkSwapchainKHR, provided the previous one was destroyed. If the oldSwapchain parameter of pCreateInfo is a valid swapchain, which has exclusive full-screen access, that access is released from pCreateInfo->oldSwapchain. If the command succeeds in this case, the newly created swapchain will automatically acquire exclusive full-screen access from pCreateInfo->oldSwapchain. This implicit transfer is intended to avoid exiting and entering full-screen exclusive mode, which may otherwise cause unwanted visual updates to the display. In some cases, swapchain creation may fail if exclusive full-screen mode is requested for application control, but for some implementation-specific reason exclusive full-screen access is unavailable for the particular combination of parameters provided. If this occurs, VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED will be returned. In particular, it will fail if the imageExtent member of pCreateInfo does not match the extents of the monitor. Other reasons for failure may include the application not being set as high-dpi aware, or if the physical device and monitor are not compatible in this mode. If the pNext chain of VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR includes a VkSwapchainPresentBarrierCreateInfoNV structure, then that structure includes additional swapchain creation parameters specific to the present barrier. Swapchain creation may fail if the state of the current system restricts the usage of the present barrier feature VkSurfaceCapabilitiesPresentBarrierNV, or a swapchain itself does not satisfy all the required conditions. In this scenario VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED is returned. When the VkSurfaceKHR in VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR is a display surface, then the VkDisplayModeKHR in display surface’s VkDisplaySurfaceCreateInfoKHR is associated with a particular VkDisplayKHR. Swapchain creation may fail if that VkDisplayKHR is not acquired by the application. In this scenario VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED is returned. Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-vkCreateSwapchainKHR-device-parameter device must be a valid VkDevice handle VUID-vkCreateSwapchainKHR-pCreateInfo-parameter pCreateInfo must be a valid pointer to a valid VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR structure VUID-vkCreateSwapchainKHR-pAllocator-parameter If pAllocator is not NULL, pAllocator must be a valid pointer to a valid VkAllocationCallbacks structure VUID-vkCreateSwapchainKHR-pSwapchain-parameter pSwapchain must be a valid pointer to a VkSwapchainKHR handle Return Codes Success VK_SUCCESS Failure VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR VK_ERROR_NATIVE_WINDOW_IN_USE_KHR VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED VK_ERROR_COMPRESSION_EXHAUSTED_EXT The VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_KHR_swapchain typedef struct VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; VkSwapchainCreateFlagsKHR flags; VkSurfaceKHR surface; uint32_t minImageCount; VkFormat imageFormat; VkColorSpaceKHR imageColorSpace; VkExtent2D imageExtent; uint32_t imageArrayLayers; VkImageUsageFlags imageUsage; VkSharingMode imageSharingMode; uint32_t queueFamilyIndexCount; const uint32_t* pQueueFamilyIndices; VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR preTransform; VkCompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR compositeAlpha; VkPresentModeKHR presentMode; VkBool32 clipped; VkSwapchainKHR oldSwapchain; } VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. flags is a bitmask of VkSwapchainCreateFlagBitsKHR indicating parameters of the swapchain creation. surface is the surface onto which the swapchain will present images. If the creation succeeds, the swapchain becomes associated with surface. minImageCount is the minimum number of presentable images that the application needs. The implementation will either create the swapchain with at least that many images, or it will fail to create the swapchain. imageFormat is a VkFormat value specifying the format the swapchain image(s) will be created with. imageColorSpace is a VkColorSpaceKHR value specifying the way the swapchain interprets image data. imageExtent is the size (in pixels) of the swapchain image(s). The behavior is platform-dependent if the image extent does not match the surface’s currentExtent as returned by vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR. On some platforms, it is normal that maxImageExtent may become (0, 0), for example when the window is minimized. In such a case, it is not possible to create a swapchain due to the Valid Usage requirements , unless scaling is selected through VkSwapchainPresentScalingCreateInfoEXT, if supported . imageArrayLayers is the number of views in a multiview/stereo surface. For non-stereoscopic-3D applications, this value is 1. imageUsage is a bitmask of VkImageUsageFlagBits describing the intended usage of the (acquired) swapchain images. imageSharingMode is the sharing mode used for the image(s) of the swapchain. queueFamilyIndexCount is the number of queue families having access to the image(s) of the swapchain when imageSharingMode is VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT. pQueueFamilyIndices is a pointer to an array of queue family indices having access to the images(s) of the swapchain when imageSharingMode is VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT. preTransform is a VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR value describing the transform, relative to the presentation engine’s natural orientation, applied to the image content prior to presentation. If it does not match the currentTransform value returned by vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR, the presentation engine will transform the image content as part of the presentation operation. compositeAlpha is a VkCompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR value indicating the alpha compositing mode to use when this surface is composited together with other surfaces on certain window systems. presentMode is the presentation mode the swapchain will use. A swapchain’s present mode determines how incoming present requests will be processed and queued internally. clipped specifies whether the Vulkan implementation is allowed to discard rendering operations that affect regions of the surface that are not visible. If clipped is VK_TRUE, the presentable images associated with the swapchain may not own all of their pixels. Pixels in the presentable images that correspond to regions of the target surface obscured by another window on the desktop, or subject to some other clipping mechanism will have undefined content when read back. Fragment shaders may not execute for these pixels, and thus any side effects they would have had will not occur. Setting VK_TRUE does not guarantee any clipping will occur, but allows more efficient presentation methods to be used on some platforms. If clipped is VK_FALSE, presentable images associated with the swapchain will own all of the pixels they contain. Applications should set this value to VK_TRUE if they do not expect to read back the content of presentable images before presenting them or after reacquiring them, and if their fragment shaders do not have any side effects that require them to run for all pixels in the presentable image. oldSwapchain is VK_NULL_HANDLE, or the existing non-retired swapchain currently associated with surface. Providing a valid oldSwapchain may aid in the resource reuse, and also allows the application to still present any images that are already acquired from it. Upon calling vkCreateSwapchainKHR with an oldSwapchain that is not VK_NULL_HANDLE, oldSwapchain is retired — even if creation of the new swapchain fails. The new swapchain is created in the non-retired state whether or not oldSwapchain is VK_NULL_HANDLE. Upon calling vkCreateSwapchainKHR with an oldSwapchain that is not VK_NULL_HANDLE, any images from oldSwapchain that are not acquired by the application may be freed by the implementation, which may occur even if creation of the new swapchain fails. The application can destroy oldSwapchain to free all memory associated with oldSwapchain. Multiple retired swapchains can be associated with the same VkSurfaceKHR through multiple uses of oldSwapchain that outnumber calls to vkDestroySwapchainKHR. After oldSwapchain is retired, the application can pass to vkQueuePresentKHR any images it had already acquired from oldSwapchain. E.g., an application may present an image from the old swapchain before an image from the new swapchain is ready to be presented. As usual, vkQueuePresentKHR may fail if oldSwapchain has entered a state that causes VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR to be returned. The application can continue to use a shared presentable image obtained from oldSwapchain until a presentable image is acquired from the new swapchain, as long as it has not entered a state that causes it to return VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR.

VK_SWAPCHAIN_CREATE_PROTECTED_BIT_KHR specifies that images created from the swapchain are protected images. VK_SWAPCHAIN_CREATE_MUTABLE_FORMAT_BIT_KHR specifies that the images of the swapchain can be used to create a VkImageView with a different format than what the swapchain was created with. The list of allowed image view formats is specified by adding a VkImageFormatListCreateInfo structure to the pNext chain of VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR. In addition, this flag also specifies that the swapchain can be created with usage flags that are not supported for the format the swapchain is created with but are supported for at least one of the allowed image view formats.

Applications can modify the presentation mode used by the swapchain on a per-presentation basis. However, all presentation modes the application intends to use with the swapchain must be specified at swapchain creation time. To specify more than one presentation mode when creating a swapchain, include the VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT structure in the pNext chain of the VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR structure. The VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1 typedef struct VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; uint32_t presentModeCount; const VkPresentModeKHR* pPresentModes; } VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. presentModeCount is the number of presentation modes provided. pPresentModes is a list of presentation modes with presentModeCount entries Valid Usage VUID-VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT-None-07762 Each entry in pPresentModes must be one of the VkPresentModeKHR values returned by vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR for the surface VUID-VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT-presentModeFifoLatestReady-10160 If the presentModeFifoLatestReady feature is not enabled, pPresentModes must not contain VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_LATEST_READY_EXT VUID-VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT-pPresentModes-07763 The entries in pPresentModes must be a subset of the present modes returned in VkSurfacePresentModeCompatibilityEXT::pPresentModes, given VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR::presentMode in VkSurfacePresentModeEXT VUID-VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT-presentMode-07764 VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR::presentMode must be included in pPresentModes Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT-sType-sType sType must be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SWAPCHAIN_PRESENT_MODES_CREATE_INFO_EXT VUID-VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT-pPresentModes-parameter pPresentModes must be a valid pointer to an array of presentModeCount valid VkPresentModeKHR values VUID-VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT-presentModeCount-arraylength presentModeCount must be greater than 0 When an application presents a swapchain image with dimensions different than those of the target surface, different behavior is possible on different platforms per their respective specifications: Presentation fails and VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR is returned Scaling is done and VK_SUCCESS or VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR is returned Unspecified scaling using an arbitrary combination of stretching, centering and/or clipping. Applications can define specific behavior when creating a swapchain by including the VkSwapchainPresentScalingCreateInfoEXT structure in the pNext chain of the VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR structure.

If scalingBehavior is 0, the result of presenting a swapchain image with dimensions that do not match the surface dimensions is implementation and platform-dependent. If presentGravityX or presentGravityY are 0, the presentation gravity must match that defined by the native platform surface on platforms which define surface gravity.

The application must not destroy a swapchain until after completion of all outstanding operations on images that were acquired from the swapchain. swapchain and all associated VkImage handles are destroyed, and must not be acquired or used any more by the application. The memory of each VkImage will only be freed after that image is no longer used by the presentation engine. For example, if one image of the swapchain is being displayed in a window, the memory for that image may not be freed until the window is destroyed, or another swapchain is created for the window. Destroying the swapchain does not invalidate the parent VkSurfaceKHR, and a new swapchain can be created with it. When a swapchain associated with a display surface is destroyed, if the image most recently presented to the display surface is from the swapchain being destroyed, then either any display resources modified by presenting images from any swapchain associated with the display surface must be reverted by the implementation to their state prior to the first present performed on one of these swapchains, or such resources must be left in their current state.

The swapchain creation parameters that affect the properties and number of presentable images must match between all the swapchains. If the displays used by any of the swapchains do not use the same presentable image layout or are incompatible in a way that prevents sharing images, swapchain creation will fail with the result code VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DISPLAY_KHR. If any error occurs, no swapchains will be created. Images presented to multiple swapchains must be re-acquired from all of them before being modified. After destroying one or more of the swapchains, the remaining swapchains and the presentable images can continue to be used.

If pSwapchainImages is NULL, then the number of presentable images for swapchain is returned in pSwapchainImageCount. Otherwise, pSwapchainImageCount must point to a variable set by the application to the number of elements in the pSwapchainImages array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually written to pSwapchainImages. If the value of pSwapchainImageCount is less than the number of presentable images for swapchain, at most pSwapchainImageCount structures will be written, and VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of VK_SUCCESS, to indicate that not all the available presentable images were returned.

However, command buffers are not allowed to reference presentable images created with VK_SWAPCHAIN_CREATE_DEFERRED_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_BIT_EXT until their indices have been returned from vkAcquireNextImageKHR at least once. Images returned by vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR are fully backed by memory before they are passed to the application, as if they are each bound completely and contiguously to a single VkDeviceMemory object , unless the swapchain is created with the VK_SWAPCHAIN_CREATE_DEFERRED_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_BIT_EXT flag . All presentable images are initially in the VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED layout, thus before using presentable images, the application must transition them to a valid layout for the intended use. Further, the lifetime of presentable images is controlled by the implementation, so applications must not destroy a presentable image. See vkDestroySwapchainKHR for further details on the lifetime of presentable images. Images can also be created by using vkCreateImage with VkImageSwapchainCreateInfoKHR and bound to swapchain memory using vkBindImageMemory2 with VkBindImageMemorySwapchainInfoKHR. These images can be used anywhere swapchain images are used, and are useful in logical devices with multiple physical devices to create peer memory bindings of swapchain memory. These images and bindings have no effect on what memory is presented. Unlike images retrieved from vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR, these images must be destroyed with vkDestroyImage. To acquire an available presentable image to use, and retrieve the index of that image, call: // Provided by VK_KHR_swapchain VkResult vkAcquireNextImageKHR( VkDevice device, VkSwapchainKHR swapchain, uint64_t timeout, VkSemaphore semaphore, VkFence fence, uint32_t* pImageIndex); device is the device associated with swapchain. swapchain is the non-retired swapchain from which an image is being acquired. timeout specifies how long the function waits, in nanoseconds, if no image is available. semaphore is VK_NULL_HANDLE or a semaphore to signal. fence is VK_NULL_HANDLE or a fence to signal. pImageIndex is a pointer to a uint32_t in which the index of the next image to use (i.e. an index into the array of images returned by vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR) is returned. If the swapchain has been created with the VK_SWAPCHAIN_CREATE_DEFERRED_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_BIT_EXT flag, the image whose index is returned in pImageIndex will be fully backed by memory before this call returns to the application, as if it is bound completely and contiguously to a single VkDeviceMemory object.

The implementation may return VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR if the swapchain no longer matches the surface properties exactly, but can still be used for presentation. When successful, vkAcquireNextImageKHR acquires a presentable image from swapchain that an application can use, and sets pImageIndex to the index of that image within the swapchain. The presentation engine may not have finished reading from the image at the time it is acquired, so the application must use semaphore and/or fence to ensure that the image layout and contents are not modified until the presentation engine reads have completed. Once vkAcquireNextImageKHR successfully acquires an image, the semaphore signal operation referenced by semaphore, if not VK_NULL_HANDLE, and the fence signal operation referenced by fence, if not VK_NULL_HANDLE, are submitted for execution. If vkAcquireNextImageKHR does not successfully acquire an image, semaphore and fence are unaffected. The order in which images are acquired is implementation-dependent, and may be different than the order the images were presented. If timeout is zero, then vkAcquireNextImageKHR does not wait, and will either successfully acquire an image, or fail and return VK_NOT_READY if no image is available. If the specified timeout period expires before an image is acquired, vkAcquireNextImageKHR returns VK_TIMEOUT. If timeout is UINT64_MAX, the timeout period is treated as infinite, and vkAcquireNextImageKHR will block until an image is acquired or an error occurs. Let S be the number of images in swapchain. If swapchain is created with VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT, let M be the maximum of the values in VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR::minImageCount when queried with each present mode in VkSwapchainPresentModesCreateInfoEXT::pPresentModes in VkSurfacePresentModeEXT. Otherwise, let M be the value of VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR::minImageCount without a VkSurfacePresentModeEXT as part of the query input. vkAcquireNextImageKHR should not be called if the number of images that the application has currently acquired is greater than S-M. If vkAcquireNextImageKHR is called when the number of images that the application has currently acquired is less than or equal to S-M, vkAcquireNextImageKHR must return in finite time with an allowed VkResult code. Returning a result in finite time guarantees that the implementation cannot deadlock an application, or suspend its execution indefinitely with correct API usage. Acquiring too many images at once may block indefinitely, which is covered by valid usage when attempting to use UINT64_MAX. For example, a scenario here is when a compositor holds on to images which are currently being presented, and there are not any vacant images left to be acquired. If the swapchain images no longer match native surface properties, either VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR or VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR must be returned. If VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR is returned, no image is acquired and attempts to present previously acquired images to the swapchain will also fail with VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR. Applications need to create a new swapchain for the surface to continue presenting if VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR is returned. VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR may happen, for example, if the platform surface has been resized but the platform is able to scale the presented images to the new size to produce valid surface updates. It is up to the application to decide whether it prefers to continue using the current swapchain in this state, or to re-create the swapchain to better match the platform surface properties. If device loss occurs (see Lost Device) before the timeout has expired, vkAcquireNextImageKHR must return in finite time with either one of the allowed success codes, or VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST. If semaphore is not VK_NULL_HANDLE, the semaphore must be unsignaled, with no signal or wait operations pending. It will become signaled when the application can use the image. Use of semaphore allows rendering operations to be recorded and submitted before the presentation engine has completed its use of the image. If fence is not equal to VK_NULL_HANDLE, the fence must be unsignaled, with no signal operations pending. It will become signaled when the application can use the image. Applications should not rely on vkAcquireNextImageKHR blocking in order to meter their rendering speed. The implementation may return from this function immediately regardless of how many presentation requests are queued, and regardless of when queued presentation requests will complete relative to the call. Instead, applications can use fence to meter their frame generation work to match the presentation rate. An application must wait until either the semaphore or fence is signaled before accessing the image’s data. When the presentable image will be accessed by some stage S, the recommended idiom for ensuring correct synchronization is: The VkSubmitInfo used to submit the image layout transition for execution includes vkAcquireNextImageKHR::semaphore in its pWaitSemaphores member, with the corresponding element of pWaitDstStageMask including S. The synchronization command that performs any necessary image layout transition includes S in both the srcStageMask and dstStageMask. After a successful return, the image indicated by pImageIndex and its data will be unmodified compared to when it was presented. Exclusive ownership of presentable images corresponding to a swapchain created with VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE as defined in Resource Sharing is not altered by a call to vkAcquireNextImageKHR. That means upon the first acquisition from such a swapchain presentable images are not owned by any queue family, while at subsequent acquisitions the presentable images remain owned by the queue family the image was previously presented on. The possible return values for vkAcquireNextImageKHR depend on the timeout provided: VK_SUCCESS is returned if an image became available. VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR is returned if the surface becomes no longer available. VK_NOT_READY is returned if timeout is zero and no image was available. VK_TIMEOUT is returned if timeout is greater than zero and less than UINT64_MAX, and no image became available within the time allowed. VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR is returned if an image became available, and the swapchain no longer matches the surface properties exactly, but can still be used to present to the surface successfully. This may happen, for example, if the platform surface has been resized but the platform is able to scale the presented images to the new size to produce valid surface updates. It is up to the application to decide whether it prefers to continue using the current swapchain indefinitely or temporarily in this state, or to re-create the swapchain to better match the platform surface properties. VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR is returned if the surface has changed in such a way that it is no longer compatible with the swapchain, and further presentation requests using the swapchain will fail. Applications must query the new surface properties and recreate their swapchain if they wish to continue presenting to the surface. If the native surface and presented image sizes no longer match, presentation may fail unless the swapchain is created with a non-zero value in VkSwapchainPresentScalingCreateInfoEXT::scalingBehavior . If presentation does succeed, the mapping from the presented image to the native surface is defined by the VkSwapchainPresentScalingCreateInfoEXT structure if provided. Otherwise it is implementation-defined. It is the application’s responsibility to detect surface size changes and react appropriately. If presentation fails because of a mismatch in the surface and presented image sizes, a VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR error will be returned. For example, consider a 4x3 window/surface that gets resized to be 3x4 (taller than wider). On some window systems, the portion of the window/surface that was previously and still is visible (the 3x3 part) will contain the same contents as before, while the remaining parts of the window will have undefined contents. Other window systems may squash/stretch the image to fill the new window size without any undefined contents, or apply some other mapping. To acquire an available presentable image to use, and retrieve the index of that image, call: // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1 with VK_KHR_swapchain, VK_KHR_device_group with VK_KHR_swapchain VkResult vkAcquireNextImage2KHR( VkDevice device, const VkAcquireNextImageInfoKHR* pAcquireInfo, uint32_t* pImageIndex); device is the device associated with swapchain. pAcquireInfo is a pointer to a VkAcquireNextImageInfoKHR structure containing parameters of the acquire. pImageIndex is a pointer to a uint32_t value specifying the index of the next image to use. If the swapchain has been created with the VK_SWAPCHAIN_CREATE_DEFERRED_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_BIT_EXT flag, the image whose index is returned in pImageIndex will be fully backed by memory before this call returns to the application.

If vkAcquireNextImageKHR is used, the device mask is considered to include all physical devices in the logical device. vkAcquireNextImage2KHR signals at most one semaphore, even if the application requests waiting for multiple physical devices to be ready via the deviceMask. However, only a single physical device can wait on that semaphore, since the semaphore becomes unsignaled when the wait succeeds. For other physical devices to wait for the image to be ready, it is necessary for the application to submit semaphore signal operation(s) to that first physical device to signal additional semaphore(s) after the wait succeeds, which the other physical device(s) can wait upon.

There is no requirement for an application to present images in the same order that they were acquired - applications can arbitrarily present any image that is currently acquired. The origin of the native orientation of the surface coordinate system is not specified in the Vulkan specification; it depends on the platform. For most platforms the origin is by default upper-left, meaning the pixel of the presented VkImage at coordinates (0,0) would appear at the upper left pixel of the platform surface (assuming VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_IDENTITY_BIT_KHR, and the display standing the right way up). The result codes VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR and VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR have the same meaning when returned by vkQueuePresentKHR as they do when returned by vkAcquireNextImageKHR. If any swapchain member of pPresentInfo was created with VK_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_APPLICATION_CONTROLLED_EXT, VK_ERROR_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_MODE_LOST_EXT will be returned if that swapchain does not have exclusive full-screen access, possibly for implementation-specific reasons outside of the application’s control. If multiple swapchains are presented, the result code is determined by applying the following rules in order: If the device is lost, VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST is returned. If any of the target surfaces are no longer available the error VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR is returned. If any of the presents would have a result of VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR if issued separately then VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR is returned. If any of the presents would have a result of VK_ERROR_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_MODE_LOST_EXT if issued separately then VK_ERROR_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_MODE_LOST_EXT is returned. If any of the presents would have a result of VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR if issued separately then VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR is returned. Otherwise VK_SUCCESS is returned. Any writes to memory backing the images referenced by the pImageIndices and pSwapchains members of pPresentInfo, that are available before vkQueuePresentKHR is executed, are automatically made visible to the read access performed by the presentation engine. This automatic visibility operation for an image happens-after the semaphore signal operation, and happens-before the presentation engine accesses the image. Presentation is a read-only operation that will not affect the content of the presentable images. Upon reacquiring the image and transitioning it away from the VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR layout, the contents will be the same as they were prior to transitioning the image to the present source layout and presenting it. However, if a mechanism other than Vulkan is used to modify the platform window associated with the swapchain, the content of all presentable images in the swapchain becomes undefined. Calls to vkQueuePresentKHR may block, but must return in finite time. The processing of the presentation happens in issue order with other queue operations, but semaphores must be used to ensure that prior rendering and other commands in the specified queue complete before the presentation begins. The presentation command itself does not delay processing of subsequent commands on the queue. However, presentation requests sent to a particular queue are always performed in order. Exact presentation timing is controlled by the semantics of the presentation engine and native platform in use. If an image is presented to a swapchain created from a display surface, the mode of the associated display will be updated, if necessary, to match the mode specified when creating the display surface. The mode switch and presentation of the specified image will be performed as one atomic operation. Queueing an image for presentation defines a set of queue operations, including waiting on the semaphores and submitting a presentation request to the presentation engine. However, the scope of this set of queue operations does not include the actual processing of the image by the presentation engine. If vkQueuePresentKHR fails to enqueue the corresponding set of queue operations, it may return VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY or VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY. If it does, the implementation must ensure that the state and contents of any resources or synchronization primitives referenced is unaffected by the call or its failure. If vkQueuePresentKHR fails in such a way that the implementation is unable to make that guarantee, the implementation must return VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST. However, if the presentation request is rejected by the presentation engine with an error VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR, VK_ERROR_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_MODE_LOST_EXT, or VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR, the set of queue operations are still considered to be enqueued and thus any semaphore wait operation specified in VkPresentInfoKHR will execute when the corresponding queue operation is complete. vkQueuePresentKHR releases the acquisition of the images referenced by imageIndices. The queue family corresponding to the queue vkQueuePresentKHR is executed on must have ownership of the presented images as defined in Resource Sharing. vkQueuePresentKHR does not alter the queue family ownership, but the presented images must not be used again before they have been reacquired using vkAcquireNextImageKHR. The application can continue to present any acquired images from a retired swapchain as long as the swapchain has not entered a state that causes vkQueuePresentKHR to return VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR.

The number may be zero. pWaitSemaphores is NULL or a pointer to an array of VkSemaphore objects with waitSemaphoreCount entries, and specifies the semaphores to wait for before issuing the present request. swapchainCount is the number of swapchains being presented to by this command. pSwapchains is a pointer to an array of VkSwapchainKHR objects with swapchainCount entries. pImageIndices is a pointer to an array of indices into the array of each swapchain’s presentable images, with swapchainCount entries. Each entry in this array identifies the image to present on the corresponding entry in the pSwapchains array. pResults is a pointer to an array of VkResult typed elements with swapchainCount entries. Applications that do not need per-swapchain results can use NULL for pResults. If non-NULL, each entry in pResults will be set to the VkResult for presenting the swapchain corresponding to the same index in pSwapchains. Before an application can present an image, the image’s layout must be transitioned to the VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR layout, or for a shared presentable image the VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHARED_PRESENT_KHR layout. When transitioning the image to VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHARED_PRESENT_KHR or VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR, there is no need to delay subsequent processing, or perform any visibility operations (as vkQueuePresentKHR performs automatic visibility operations). To achieve this, the dstAccessMask member of the VkImageMemoryBarrier should be 0, and the dstStageMask parameter should be VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_BOTTOM_OF_PIPE_BIT.

This is an optimization hint that a presentation engine may use to only update the region of a surface that is actually changing. The application still must ensure that all pixels of a presented image contain the desired values, in case the presentation engine ignores this hint. An application can provide this hint by adding a VkPresentRegionsKHR structure to the pNext chain of the VkPresentInfoKHR structure. The VkPresentRegionsKHR structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_KHR_incremental_present typedef struct VkPresentRegionsKHR { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; uint32_t swapchainCount; const VkPresentRegionKHR* pRegions; } VkPresentRegionsKHR; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. swapchainCount is the number of swapchains being presented to by this command. pRegions is NULL or a pointer to an array of VkPresentRegionKHR elements with swapchainCount entries.

The VkRectLayerKHR structure is the framebuffer coordinates, plus layer, of a portion of a presentable image that has changed and must be presented. If non-NULL, each entry in pRectangles is a rectangle of the given image that has changed since the last image was presented to the given swapchain. The rectangles must be specified relative to VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR::currentTransform, regardless of the swapchain’s preTransform.

For images with only one layer, the value of layer must be 0. Some platforms allow the size of a surface to change, and then scale the pixels of the image to fit the surface. VkRectLayerKHR specifies pixels of the swapchain’s image(s), which will be constant for the life of the swapchain.

The VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_KHR_display_swapchain typedef struct VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; VkRect2D srcRect; VkRect2D dstRect; VkBool32 persistent; } VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. srcRect is a rectangular region of pixels to present. It must be a subset of the image being presented. If VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR is not specified, this region will be assumed to be the entire presentable image. dstRect is a rectangular region within the visible region of the swapchain’s display mode. If VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR is not specified, this region will be assumed to be the entire visible region of the swapchain’s mode. If the specified rectangle is a subset of the display mode’s visible region, content from display planes below the swapchain’s plane will be visible outside the rectangle. If there are no planes below the swapchain’s, the area outside the specified rectangle will be black. If portions of the specified rectangle are outside of the display’s visible region, pixels mapping only to those portions of the rectangle will be discarded. persistent: If this is VK_TRUE, the display engine will enable buffered mode on displays that support it. This allows the display engine to stop sending content to the display until a new image is presented. The display will instead maintain a copy of the last presented image. This allows less power to be used, but may increase presentation latency. If VkDisplayPresentInfoKHR is not specified, persistent mode will not be used.

If mode is VK_DEVICE_GROUP_PRESENT_MODE_LOCAL_BIT_KHR, then each element of pDeviceMasks selects which instance of the swapchain image is presented. Each element of pDeviceMasks must have exactly one bit set, and the corresponding physical device must have a presentation engine as reported by VkDeviceGroupPresentCapabilitiesKHR. If mode is VK_DEVICE_GROUP_PRESENT_MODE_REMOTE_BIT_KHR, then each element of pDeviceMasks selects which instance of the swapchain image is presented. Each element of pDeviceMasks must have exactly one bit set, and some physical device in the logical device must include that bit in its VkDeviceGroupPresentCapabilitiesKHR::presentMask. If mode is VK_DEVICE_GROUP_PRESENT_MODE_SUM_BIT_KHR, then each element of pDeviceMasks selects which instances of the swapchain image are component-wise summed and the sum of those images is presented. If the sum in any component is outside the representable range, the value of that component is undefined. Each element of pDeviceMasks must have a value for which all set bits are set in one of the elements of VkDeviceGroupPresentCapabilitiesKHR::presentMask.

This allows an application to avoid stutter that is caused by an image being displayed earlier than planned. Such stuttering can occur with both fixed and variable-refresh-rate displays, because stuttering occurs when the geometry is not correctly positioned for when the image is displayed.

Valid Usage VUID-VkPresentTimesInfoGOOGLE-swapchainCount-01247 swapchainCount must be the same value as VkPresentInfoKHR::swapchainCount, where VkPresentInfoKHR is included in the pNext chain of this VkPresentTimesInfoGOOGLE structure Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-VkPresentTimesInfoGOOGLE-sType-sType sType must be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PRESENT_TIMES_INFO_GOOGLE VUID-VkPresentTimesInfoGOOGLE-pTimes-parameter If pTimes is not NULL, pTimes must be a valid pointer to an array of swapchainCount VkPresentTimeGOOGLE structures VUID-VkPresentTimesInfoGOOGLE-swapchainCount-arraylength swapchainCount must be greater than 0 The VkPresentTimeGOOGLE structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_GOOGLE_display_timing typedef struct VkPresentTimeGOOGLE { uint32_t presentID; uint64_t desiredPresentTime; } VkPresentTimeGOOGLE; presentID is an application-provided identification value, that can be used with the results of vkGetPastPresentationTimingGOOGLE, in order to uniquely identify this present. In order to be useful to the application, it should be unique within some period of time that is meaningful to the application. desiredPresentTime specifies that the image given should not be displayed to the user any earlier than this time. desiredPresentTime is a time in nanoseconds, relative to a monotonically-increasing clock (e.g. CLOCK_MONOTONIC (see clock_gettime(2)) on Android and Linux). A value of zero specifies that the presentation engine may display the image at any time. This is useful when the application desires to provide presentID, but does not need a specific desiredPresentTime. The VkPresentIdKHR structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_KHR_present_id typedef struct VkPresentIdKHR { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; uint32_t swapchainCount; const uint64_t* pPresentIds; } VkPresentIdKHR; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. swapchainCount is the number of swapchains being presented to the vkQueuePresentKHR command. pPresentIds is NULL or a pointer to an array of uint64_t with swapchainCount entries. If not NULL, each non-zero value in pPresentIds specifies the present id to be associated with the presentation of the swapchain with the same index in the vkQueuePresentKHR call. For applications to be able to reference specific presentation events queued by a call to vkQueuePresentKHR, an identifier needs to be associated with them. When the presentId feature is enabled, applications can include the VkPresentIdKHR structure in the pNext chain of the VkPresentInfoKHR structure to supply identifiers. Each VkSwapchainKHR has a presentId associated with it. This value is initially zero when the VkSwapchainKHR is created. When a VkPresentIdKHR structure with a non-NULL pPresentIds is included in the pNext chain of a VkPresentInfoKHR structure, each pSwapchains entry has a presentId associated in the pPresentIds array at the same index as the swapchain in the pSwapchains array. If this presentId is non-zero, then the application can later use this value to refer to that image presentation. A value of zero indicates that this presentation has no associated presentId. A non-zero presentId must be greater than any non-zero presentId passed previously by the application for the same swapchain. There is no requirement for any precise timing relationship between the presentation of the image to the user and the update of the presentId value, but implementations should make this as close as possible to the presentation of the first pixel in the new image to the user. Valid Usage VUID-VkPresentIdKHR-swapchainCount-04998 swapchainCount must be the same value as VkPresentInfoKHR::swapchainCount, where this VkPresentIdKHR is in the pNext chain of the VkPresentInfoKHR structure VUID-VkPresentIdKHR-presentIds-04999 Each presentIds entry must be greater than any previous presentIds entry passed for the associated pSwapchains entry Valid Usage (Implicit) VUID-VkPresentIdKHR-sType-sType sType must be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PRESENT_ID_KHR VUID-VkPresentIdKHR-pPresentIds-parameter If pPresentIds is not NULL, pPresentIds must be a valid pointer to an array of swapchainCount uint64_t values VUID-VkPresentIdKHR-swapchainCount-arraylength swapchainCount must be greater than 0 When the presentWait feature is enabled, an application can wait for an image to be presented to the user by first specifying a presentId for the target presentation by adding a VkPresentIdKHR structure to the pNext chain of the VkPresentInfoKHR structure and then waiting for that presentation to complete by calling: // Provided by VK_KHR_present_wait VkResult vkWaitForPresentKHR( VkDevice device, VkSwapchainKHR swapchain, uint64_t presentId, uint64_t timeout); device is the device associated with swapchain. swapchain is the non-retired swapchain on which an image was queued for presentation. presentId is the presentation presentId to wait for. timeout is the timeout period in units of nanoseconds. timeout is adjusted to the closest value allowed by the implementation-dependent timeout accuracy, which may be substantially longer than one nanosecond, and may be longer than the requested period. vkWaitForPresentKHR waits for the presentId associated with swapchain to be increased in value so that it is at least equal to presentId. For VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR (or other present mode where images may be replaced in the presentation queue) any wait of this type associated with such an image must be signaled no later than a wait associated with the replacing image would be signaled. When the presentation has completed, the presentId associated with the related pSwapchains entry will be increased in value so that it is at least equal to the value provided in the VkPresentIdKHR structure. There is no requirement for any precise timing relationship between the presentation of the image to the user and the update of the presentId value, but implementations should make this as close as possible to the presentation of the first pixel in the next image being presented to the user. The call to vkWaitForPresentKHR will block until either the presentId associated with swapchain is greater than or equal to presentId, or timeout nanoseconds passes. When the swapchain becomes OUT_OF_DATE, the call will either return VK_SUCCESS (if the image was delivered to the presentation engine and may have been presented to the user) or will return early with status VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR (if the image was not presented to the user). As an exception to the normal rules for objects which are externally synchronized, the swapchain passed to vkWaitForPresentKHR may be simultaneously used by other threads in calls to functions other than vkDestroySwapchainKHR. Access to the swapchain data associated with this extension must be atomic within the implementation.

The VkPresentFrameTokenGGP structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_GGP_frame_token typedef struct VkPresentFrameTokenGGP { VkStructureType sType; const void* pNext; GgpFrameToken frameToken; } VkPresentFrameTokenGGP; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. frameToken is the Google Games Platform frame token.

If the pNext chain of VkPresentInfoKHR includes a VkSwapchainPresentModeInfoEXT structure, then that structure defines the presentation modes used for the current and subsequent presentation operations. When the application changes present modes with VkSwapchainPresentModeInfoEXT, images that have already been queued for presentation will continue to be presented according to the previous present mode. The current image being queued for presentation and subsequent images will be presented according to the new present mode. The behavior during the transition between the two modes is defined as follows. Transition from VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_CONTINUOUS_REFRESH_KHR to VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_DEMAND_REFRESH_KHR: the presentation engine updates the shared presentable image according to the behavior of VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_DEMAND_REFRESH_KHR. Transition from VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_DEMAND_REFRESH_KHR to VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_CONTINUOUS_REFRESH_KHR: the presentation engine may update the shared presentable image or defer that to its regular refresh cycle, according to the behavior of VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_CONTINUOUS_REFRESH_KHR. Transition between VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR and VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR: Images continue to be appended to the same FIFO queue, and the behavior with respect to waiting for vertical blanking period will follow the new mode for current and subsequent images. Transition from VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR to VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR or VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR or VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_LATEST_READY_EXT : As all prior present requests in the VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR mode are applied immediately, there are no outstanding present operations in this mode, and current and subsequent images are appended to the FIFO queue and presented according to the new mode. Transition from VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR to VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR or VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR or VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_LATEST_READY_EXT : Presentation in FIFO modes require waiting for the next vertical blanking period, with VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR allowing the pending present operation to be replaced by a new one. In this case, the current present operation will replace the pending present operation and is applied according to the new mode. Transition from VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR or VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR or VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_LATEST_READY_EXT to VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR or VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR: If the FIFO queue is empty, presentation is done according to the behavior of the new mode. If there are present operations in the FIFO queue, once the last present operation is performed based on the respective vertical blanking period, the current and subsequent updates are applied according to the new mode. Transition between VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR or VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR, and VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_LATEST_READY_EXT: Images continue to be appended to the same FIFO queue, and the behavior with respect to waiting for vertical blanking period and dequeuing requests will follow the new mode for current and subsequent images. The behavior during transition between any other present modes, if possible, is implementation defined.

Each entry must be VK_NULL_HANDLE or the handle of a fence to signal when the relevant operations on the associated swapchain have completed. The set of queue operations defined by queuing an image for presentation, as well as operations performed by the presentation engine access the payloads of objects associated with the presentation operation. The associated objects include: The swapchain image, its implicitly bound memory, and any other resources bound to that memory. The wait semaphores specified when queuing the image for presentation. The application can provide a fence that the implementation will signal when all such queue operations have completed and the presentation engine has taken a reference to the payload of any objects it accesses as part of the present operation. For all binary wait semaphores imported by the presentation engine using the equivalent of reference transference, as described in Importing Semaphore Payloads, this fence must not signal until all such semaphore payloads have been reset by the presentation engine. The application can destroy the wait semaphores associated with a given presentation operation when at least one of the associated fences is signaled, and can destroy the swapchain when the fences associated with all past presentation requests referring to that swapchain have signaled. Fences associated with presentations to the same swapchain on the same VkQueue must be signaled in the same order as the present operations. To specify a fence for each swapchain in a present operation, include the VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoEXT structure in the pNext chain of the VkPresentInfoKHR structure.

Only images that are not in use by the device can be released. Releasing images is a read-only operation that will not affect the content of the released images. Upon reacquiring the image, the image contents and its layout will be the same as they were prior to releasing it. However, if a mechanism other than Vulkan is used to modify the platform window associated with the swapchain, the content of all presentable images in the swapchain becomes undefined. This functionality is useful during swapchain recreation, where acquired images from the old swapchain can be released instead of presented.

Some implementations support extensions to reduce display latency and control the swapchain present interval, as described in the remainder of this section.

To allow low latency mode to be used by a swapchain, add a VkSwapchainLatencyCreateInfoNV structure to the pNext chain of VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR.

If the value of presentModeCount is less than the number of optimized present modes, at most presentModeCount values will be written to pPresentModes.

A swapchain is said to be using the present barrier if the swapchain is created by adding a VkSwapchainPresentBarrierCreateInfoNV structure to the pNext chain of the VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR structure, and setting VkSwapchainPresentBarrierCreateInfoNV::presentBarrierEnable to true. A set of corresponding presentation requests is defined as exactly one queued presentation request associated with each swapchain using the present barrier, whether or not that queued request has executed. A given presentation request is added, when created by calling vkQueuePresentKHR and specifying a swapchain using the present barrier, either to the oldest existing set of corresponding requests for which there is no existing member associated with the request’s swapchain, or to a new set of corresponding requests if no such set exists. A set of corresponding requests is said to be full when it contains one request from each swapchain using the present barrier. Queued presentation of an image to a swapchain using the present barrier is deferred by the implementation until the set of corresponding requests is full, and the visibility operations associated with all requests in that set, as described by vkQueuePresentKHR, have completed. Additionally, the set of swapchains using the present barrier can be in the same process, or different processes running under the same operating system. And if the required synchronization hardware is connected and correctly configured, this extension also supports applications to synchronize corresponding presentation requests using the present barrier across distributed systems. However, the configuration mechanism of the required hardware is outside the scope of the Vulkan specification and this extension. The VkSwapchainPresentBarrierCreateInfoNV structure is defined as: // Provided by VK_NV_present_barrier typedef struct VkSwapchainPresentBarrierCreateInfoNV { VkStructureType sType; void* pNext; VkBool32 presentBarrierEnable; } VkSwapchainPresentBarrierCreateInfoNV; sType is a VkStructureType value identifying this structure. pNext is NULL or a pointer to a structure extending this structure. presentBarrierEnable is a boolean value indicating a request for using the present barrier. If the pNext chain of VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR does not include this structure, the default value for presentBarrierEnable is VK_FALSE, meaning the swapchain does not request to use the present barrier. Additionally, when recreating a swapchain that was using the present barrier, and the pNext chain of VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR does not include this structure, it means the swapchain will stop using the present barrier.

The configuration specified by VkSetPresentConfigNV applies to the next numFramesPerBatch calls to vkQueuePresentKHR and needs to be updated every numFramesPerBatch presents.
