## Content

This site includes the OpenGL Shading Language, Version 4.60.9 specification. The site is organized in “components” (Antora terminology for specifications and other documents), each containing many “pages” (Antora terminology for a chapter of a specification, or other distinct piece of content for other components). The left navigation sidebar links to pages in the current component. The right navigation sidebar links to sections in the current page. The bottom-left button switches between components. The top navigation bar contains a text searchbox. If the “In this component” box is checked, search will be restricted to the current component. Otherwise, all components of the site are searched. This site is generated using the Antora static site generator. If you need to report a problem or build the site yourself, start with the Vulkan-Site repository on GitHub.
