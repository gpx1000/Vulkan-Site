vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresIndirectKHR - Build an acceleration structure with some parameters provided on the device

To build acceleration structures with some parameters sourced on the device
call:

// Provided by VK_KHR_acceleration_structure
void vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresIndirectKHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    infoCount,
    const VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR* pInfos,
    const VkDeviceAddress*                      pIndirectDeviceAddresses,
    const uint32_t*                             pIndirectStrides,
    const uint32_t* const*                      ppMaxPrimitiveCounts);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be
recorded.

* 
`infoCount` is the number of acceleration structures to build.

* 
`pInfos` is a pointer to an array of `infoCount`
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR.html) structures defining
the geometry used to build each acceleration structure.

* 
`pIndirectDeviceAddresses` is a pointer to an array of
`infoCount` buffer device addresses which point to
`pInfos`[i].`geometryCount`
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR](VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR.html) structures defining
dynamic offsets to the addresses where geometry data is stored, as
defined by `pInfos`[i].

* 
`pIndirectStrides` is a pointer to an array of `infoCount` byte
strides between elements of `pIndirectDeviceAddresses`.

* 
`ppMaxPrimitiveCounts` is a pointer to an array of `infoCount`
pointers to arrays of `pInfos`[i].`geometryCount` values
indicating the maximum number of primitives that will be built by this
command for each geometry.

Accesses to acceleration structures, scratch buffers, vertex buffers, index
buffers, and instance buffers **must** be synchronized as with
[vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/accelstructures.html#acceleration-structure-scratch).

Accesses to any element of `pIndirectDeviceAddresses` **must** be
[synchronized](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies) with the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages) and an
[access type](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-access-types) of
`VK_ACCESS_INDIRECT_COMMAND_READ_BIT`.
