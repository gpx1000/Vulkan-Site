VkPhysicalDeviceImage2DViewOf3DFeaturesEXT - Structure describing whether single-slice 2D views of 3D images can be used in image descriptors

The `VkPhysicalDeviceImage2DViewOf3DFeaturesEXT` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_image_2d_view_of_3d
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceImage2DViewOf3DFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           image2DViewOf3D;
    VkBool32           sampler2DViewOf3D;
} VkPhysicalDeviceImage2DViewOf3DFeaturesEXT;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `image2DViewOf3D` indicates that the
implementation supports using a 2D view of a 3D image in a descriptor of
type `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_IMAGE` if the image is created
using `VK_IMAGE_CREATE_2D_VIEW_COMPATIBLE_BIT_EXT`.

* 
 `sampler2DViewOf3D` indicates that
the implementation supports using a 2D view of a 3D image in a
descriptor of type `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLED_IMAGE` or
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER` if the image is created
using `VK_IMAGE_CREATE_2D_VIEW_COMPATIBLE_BIT_EXT`.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceImage2DViewOf3DFeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceImage2DViewOf3DFeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceImage2DViewOf3DFeaturesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceImage2DViewOf3DFeaturesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_IMAGE_2D_VIEW_OF_3D_FEATURES_EXT`

[VK_EXT_image_2d_view_of_3d](VK_EXT_image_2d_view_of_3d.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
