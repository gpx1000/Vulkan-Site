vkCmdBindPipeline - Bind a pipeline object to a command buffer

Once a pipeline has been created, it **can** be bound to the command buffer
using the command:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
void vkCmdBindPipeline(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkPipelineBindPoint                         pipelineBindPoint,
    VkPipeline                                  pipeline);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer that the pipeline will be
bound to.

* 
`pipelineBindPoint` is a [VkPipelineBindPoint](VkPipelineBindPoint.html) value specifying
to which bind point the pipeline is bound.
Binding one does not disturb the others.

* 
`pipeline` is the pipeline to be bound.

Once bound, a pipeline binding affects subsequent commands that interact
with the given pipeline type in the command buffer until a different
pipeline of the same type is bound to the bind
point, or until the pipeline bind point is disturbed by binding a
[shader object](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/shaders.html#shaders-objects) as described in
[Interaction with Pipelines](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/shaders.html#shaders-objects-pipeline-interaction).
Commands that do not interact with the [given pipeline](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/shaders.html#shaders-binding)
type **must** not be affected by the pipeline state.

is a graphics pipeline, the current subpass [    uses no attachments](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/renderpass.html#renderpass-noattachments), and this is not the first call to this function
with a graphics pipeline after transitioning to the current subpass,
then the sample count specified by this pipeline **must** match that set in
the previous pipeline
