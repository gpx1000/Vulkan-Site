VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 - Structure describing the fine-grained features that can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 {
    VkStructureType             sType;
    void*                       pNext;
    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures    features;
} VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`features` is a [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures.html) structure describing
the fine-grained features of the Vulkan 1.0 API.

The `pNext` chain of this structure is used to extend the structure with
features defined by extensions.
This structure **can** be used in [vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) or **can** be
included in the `pNext` chain of a [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) structure,
in which case it controls which features are enabled in lieu of
`pEnabledFeatures`.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_FEATURES_2`
