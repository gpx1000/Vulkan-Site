// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2
void vkCmdBeginRenderPass2(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkRenderPassBeginInfo*                pRenderPassBegin,
    const VkSubpassBeginInfo*                   pSubpassBeginInfo);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_create_renderpass2
void vkCmdBeginRenderPass2KHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkRenderPassBeginInfo*                pRenderPassBegin,
    const VkSubpassBeginInfo*                   pSubpassBeginInfo);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer in which to record the
command.

* 
`pRenderPassBegin` is a pointer to a [VkRenderPassBeginInfo](VkRenderPassBeginInfo.html)
structure specifying the render pass to begin an instance of, and the
framebuffer the instance uses.
After recording this command, the render pass and framebuffer **may** be
accessed at any point that `commandBuffer` is in the recording or
pending state until it is reset.

* 
`pSubpassBeginInfo` is a pointer to a [VkSubpassBeginInfo](VkSubpassBeginInfo.html)
structure containing information about the subpass which is about to
begin rendering.

After beginning a render pass instance, the command buffer is ready to
record the commands for the first subpass of that render pass.
