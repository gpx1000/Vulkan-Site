VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV - Structure describing cooperative vector features that can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_NV_cooperative_vector
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           cooperativeVector;
    VkBool32           cooperativeVectorTraining;
} VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `cooperativeVector` indicates that
the implementation supports the `CooperativeVectorNV` SPIR-V
capability.

* 
 `cooperativeVectorTraining`
indicates that the implementation supports the
`CooperativeVectorTrainingNV` SPIR-V capability.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_COOPERATIVE_VECTOR_FEATURES_NV`

[VK_NV_cooperative_vector](VK_NV_cooperative_vector.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
