vkCmdClearAttachments - Clear regions within bound framebuffer attachments

To clear one or more regions of color and depth/stencil attachments inside a
render pass instance, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
void vkCmdClearAttachments(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    attachmentCount,
    const VkClearAttachment*                    pAttachments,
    uint32_t                                    rectCount,
    const VkClearRect*                          pRects);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be
recorded.

* 
`attachmentCount` is the number of entries in the `pAttachments`
array.

* 
`pAttachments` is a pointer to an array of [VkClearAttachment](VkClearAttachment.html)
structures defining the attachments to clear and the clear values to
use.

* 
`rectCount` is the number of entries in the `pRects` array.

* 
`pRects` is a pointer to an array of [VkClearRect](VkClearRect.html) structures
defining regions to clear for every attachment in `pAttachments`.

If the render pass has a [fragment density map attachment](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/renderpass.html#renderpass-fragmentdensitymapattachment), clears follow the
[operations of fragment density maps](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/fragmentdensitymapops.html#fragmentdensitymapops) as if each
clear region was a primitive which generates fragments.
The clear color is applied to all pixels inside each fragment’s area
regardless if the pixels lie outside of the clear region.
Clears **may** have a different set of supported fragment areas than draws.

Unlike other [clear commands](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/clears.html#clears), [vkCmdClearAttachments](#) is not a
transfer command.
It performs its operations in [rasterization order](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/primsrast.html#primsrast-order).
For color attachments, the operations are executed as color attachment
writes, by the `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT` stage.
For depth/stencil attachments, the operations are executed as
[depth writes](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/fragops.html#fragops-depth) and [stencil writes](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/fragops.html#fragops-stencil) by
the `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_EARLY_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT` and
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_LATE_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT` stages.

`vkCmdClearAttachments` is not affected by the bound pipeline state.

|  | It is generally preferable to clear attachments by using the
| --- | --- |
`VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR` load operation at the start of rendering,
as it is more efficient on some implementations. |

If any attachment’s `aspectMask` to be cleared is not backed by an image
view, the clear has no effect on that aspect.

If an attachment being cleared refers to an image view created with an
`aspectMask` equal to one of `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_0_BIT`,
`VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_1_BIT` or `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_2_BIT`, it
is considered to be `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT` for purposes of this
command, and **must** be cleared with the `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT`
aspect as specified by [image view creation](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/resources.html#image-views-plane-promotion).
