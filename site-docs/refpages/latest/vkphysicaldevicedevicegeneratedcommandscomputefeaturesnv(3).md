VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceGeneratedCommandsComputeFeaturesNV - Structure describing the device-generated compute features that can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceGeneratedCommandsComputeFeaturesNV` structure
is defined as:

// Provided by VK_NV_device_generated_commands_compute
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceGeneratedCommandsComputeFeaturesNV {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           deviceGeneratedCompute;
    VkBool32           deviceGeneratedComputePipelines;
    VkBool32           deviceGeneratedComputeCaptureReplay;
} VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceGeneratedCommandsComputeFeaturesNV;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `deviceGeneratedCompute`
indicates whether the implementation supports functionality to generate
dispatch commands and push constants for the compute pipeline on the
device.
See [Device-Generated Commands](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/device_generated_commands/generatedcommands.html#device-generated-commands).

* 

`deviceGeneratedComputePipelines` indicates whether the
implementation supports functionality to generate commands to bind
compute pipelines on the device.
See [Device-Generated Commands](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/device_generated_commands/generatedcommands.html#device-generated-commands).

* 

`deviceGeneratedComputeCaptureReplay` indicates whether the
implementation supports functionality to capture compute pipeline
address and reuse later for replay in
[Device-Generated Commands](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/device_generated_commands/generatedcommands.html#device-generated-commands).

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceGeneratedCommandsComputeFeaturesNV` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceGeneratedCommandsComputeFeaturesNV`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceGeneratedCommandsComputeFeaturesNV-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceGeneratedCommandsComputeFeaturesNV-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_DEVICE_GENERATED_COMMANDS_COMPUTE_FEATURES_NV`

[VK_NV_device_generated_commands_compute](VK_NV_device_generated_commands_compute.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
