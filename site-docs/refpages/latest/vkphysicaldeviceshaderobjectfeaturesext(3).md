VkPhysicalDeviceShaderObjectFeaturesEXT - Structure describing whether shader objects can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderObjectFeaturesEXT` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_shader_object
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceShaderObjectFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           shaderObject;
} VkPhysicalDeviceShaderObjectFeaturesEXT;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
 `shaderObject` indicates whether the
implementation supports [shader objects](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/shaders.html#shaders-objects).

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderObjectFeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderObjectFeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceShaderObjectFeaturesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceShaderObjectFeaturesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_SHADER_OBJECT_FEATURES_EXT`

[VK_EXT_shader_object](VK_EXT_shader_object.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
