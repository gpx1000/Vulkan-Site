DrawIndex - Index of the current draw

`DrawIndex`

Decorating a variable with the `DrawIndex` built-in will make that
variable contain the integer value corresponding to the zero-based index of
the draw that invoked the current
task, mesh, or
vertex shader invocation.
For *indirect drawing commands*, `DrawIndex` begins at zero and
increments by one for each draw executed.
The number of draws is given by the `drawCount` parameter.
For *direct drawing commands*,
if [vkCmdDrawMultiEXT](vkCmdDrawMultiEXT.html) or [vkCmdDrawMultiIndexedEXT](vkCmdDrawMultiIndexedEXT.html) is used, this
variable contains the integer value corresponding to the zero-based index of
the draw.
Otherwise
`DrawIndex` is always zero.
`DrawIndex` is dynamically uniform.

When task or mesh shaders are used, only the first active stage will have
proper access to the variable.
The value read by other stages is **undefined**.

Valid Usage

* 
[](#VUID-DrawIndex-DrawIndex-04207) VUID-DrawIndex-DrawIndex-04207

The `DrawIndex` decoration **must** be used only within the `Vertex`,
`MeshEXT`, `TaskEXT`, `MeshNV`, or `TaskNV` `Execution` `Model`

* 
[](#VUID-DrawIndex-DrawIndex-04208) VUID-DrawIndex-DrawIndex-04208

The variable decorated with `DrawIndex` **must** be declared using the
`Input` `Storage` `Class`

* 
[](#VUID-DrawIndex-DrawIndex-04209) VUID-DrawIndex-DrawIndex-04209

The variable decorated with `DrawIndex` **must** be declared as a scalar
32-bit integer value
