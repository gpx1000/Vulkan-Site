vkGetBufferDeviceAddress - Query an address of a buffer

To query a 64-bit buffer device address value which can be used to identify
a buffer to API commands or through which buffer memory **can** be accessed,
call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2
VkDeviceAddress vkGetBufferDeviceAddress(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo*            pInfo);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_buffer_device_address
VkDeviceAddress vkGetBufferDeviceAddressKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo*            pInfo);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_EXT_buffer_device_address
VkDeviceAddress vkGetBufferDeviceAddressEXT(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo*            pInfo);

* 
`device` is the logical device that the buffer was created on.

* 
`pInfo` is a pointer to a [VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo](VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo.html) structure
specifying the buffer to retrieve an address for.

The 64-bit return value, `bufferBaseAddress`, is an address of the
start of `pInfo->buffer`.
Addresses in the range [`bufferBaseAddress`, `bufferBaseAddress`
+  [VkBufferCreateInfo](VkBufferCreateInfo.html)::`size`) **can** be used to access the
memory bound to this buffer on the device.

A value of zero is reserved as a “null” pointer and **must** not be returned
as a valid buffer device address.

If the buffer was created with a non-zero value of
[VkBufferOpaqueCaptureAddressCreateInfo](VkBufferOpaqueCaptureAddressCreateInfo.html)::`opaqueCaptureAddress` or
[VkBufferDeviceAddressCreateInfoEXT](VkBufferDeviceAddressCreateInfoEXT.html)::`deviceAddress`,
the return value will be the same address that was returned at capture time.

The returned address **must** satisfy the alignment requirement specified by
[VkMemoryRequirements](VkMemoryRequirements.html)::`alignment` for the buffer in
[VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo](VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo.html)::`buffer`.

If multiple [VkBuffer](VkBuffer.html) objects are bound to overlapping ranges of
[VkDeviceMemory](VkDeviceMemory.html), implementations **may** return address ranges which
overlap.
In this case, it is ambiguous which [VkBuffer](VkBuffer.html) is associated with any
given device address.
For purposes of valid usage, if multiple [VkBuffer](VkBuffer.html) objects **can** be
attributed to a device address, a [VkBuffer](VkBuffer.html) is selected such that valid
usage passes, if it exists.

Valid Usage

* 
[](#VUID-vkGetBufferDeviceAddress-bufferDeviceAddress-03324) VUID-vkGetBufferDeviceAddress-bufferDeviceAddress-03324

The [`bufferDeviceAddress`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-bufferDeviceAddress) feature
or the [    `VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeaturesEXT`::`bufferDeviceAddress`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-bufferDeviceAddressEXT)
feature
**must** be enabled, and at least one of the following conditions **must** be
met

`buffer` is sparse

* 
`buffer` is bound completely and contiguously to a single
`VkDeviceMemory` object

* 
`buffer` was created with the
`VK_BUFFER_CREATE_DEVICE_ADDRESS_CAPTURE_REPLAY_BIT` flag and the
[     `VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeaturesEXT`::`bufferDeviceAddress`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-bufferDeviceAddressEXT)
feature is enabled on the device

[](#VUID-vkGetBufferDeviceAddress-device-03325) VUID-vkGetBufferDeviceAddress-device-03325

If `device` was created with multiple physical devices, then the
[    `bufferDeviceAddressMultiDevice`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-bufferDeviceAddressMultiDevice)
or [    `VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeaturesEXT`::`bufferDeviceAddressMultiDevice`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-bufferDeviceAddressMultiDeviceEXT)
feature **must** be enabled

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-vkGetBufferDeviceAddress-device-parameter) VUID-vkGetBufferDeviceAddress-device-parameter

 `device` **must** be a valid [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) handle

* 
[](#VUID-vkGetBufferDeviceAddress-pInfo-parameter) VUID-vkGetBufferDeviceAddress-pInfo-parameter

 `pInfo` **must** be a valid pointer to a valid [VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo](VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo.html) structure

[VK_KHR_buffer_device_address](VK_KHR_buffer_device_address.html), [VK_VERSION_1_2](VK_VERSION_1_2.html), [VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo](VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo.html), [VkDevice](VkDevice.html)
