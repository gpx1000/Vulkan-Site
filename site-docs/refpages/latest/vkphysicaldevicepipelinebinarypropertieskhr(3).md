VkPhysicalDevicePipelineBinaryPropertiesKHR - Structure describing properties about the pipeline binary implementation

The `VkPhysicalDevicePipelineBinaryPropertiesKHR` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_pipeline_binary
typedef struct VkPhysicalDevicePipelineBinaryPropertiesKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           pipelineBinaryInternalCache;
    VkBool32           pipelineBinaryInternalCacheControl;
    VkBool32           pipelineBinaryPrefersInternalCache;
    VkBool32           pipelineBinaryPrecompiledInternalCache;
    VkBool32           pipelineBinaryCompressedData;
} VkPhysicalDevicePipelineBinaryPropertiesKHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `pipelineBinaryInternalCache`
specifies that the implementation maintains a pipeline cache internal to
the implementation.
If this is `VK_TRUE`, applications **can** create pipeline binaries
with only a pipeline create info, and in this case, an implementation
**may** be able to create a pipeline binary directly without application
needing to capture the binary itself.

* 

`pipelineBinaryInternalCacheControl` specifies whether the driver’s
internal cache **can** be disabled.
If this property is `VK_TRUE`
[VkDevicePipelineBinaryInternalCacheControlKHR](VkDevicePipelineBinaryInternalCacheControlKHR.html)::`disableInternalCache`
**can** be used to disable the driver’s internal cache, allowing an
application to take full control of both memory and disk usage.

* 

`pipelineBinaryPrefersInternalCache` specifies that the
implementation prefers to maintain an internal cache, and applications
**should** not store pipeline binaries in their own on-disk caches to avoid
increased on-disk storage requirements.
Applications are encouraged to only store pipeline keys instead, and aim
to create pipeline binaries from key alone on subsequent runs of the
application.

* 

`pipelineBinaryPrecompiledInternalCache` specifies that the
implementation **may** have pipeline binaries in its internal cache, which
is populated without the application ever having generated that pipeline
itself.
Applications **can** attempt to create binaries without extracting pipeline
binary data from the pipeline prior for a set of pipeline keys,
including from previous runs of the application.

* 

`pipelineBinaryCompressedData` specifies that the binary data is
already compressed and so applications **should** not attempt to compress
it.

|  | These properties tend to be platform specific and may change depending on
| --- | --- |
external configuration which is outside the scope of this specification.
These properties are intended to guide applications when implementations
have dedicated caching solutions available.
In particular, if the `pipelineBinaryPrefersInternalCache` limit is
exposed, relying on the internal cache may provide some advantage compared
to an application-specific solution.
An application with its own dedicated solution may still use its own caching
system even with this limit exposed. |

If the `VkPhysicalDevicePipelineBinaryPropertiesKHR` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2](VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2.html), it is filled in with each
corresponding implementation-dependent property.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PIPELINE_BINARY_PROPERTIES_KHR`

[VK_KHR_pipeline_binary](VK_KHR_pipeline_binary.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
