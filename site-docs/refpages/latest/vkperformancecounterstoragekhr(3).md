VkPerformanceCounterStorageKHR - Supported counter storage types

Performance counters have an associated storage.
This storage describes the payload of a counter result.

The performance counter storage types which **may** be returned in
[VkPerformanceCounterKHR](VkPerformanceCounterKHR.html)::`storage` are:

// Provided by VK_KHR_performance_query
typedef enum VkPerformanceCounterStorageKHR {
    VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_STORAGE_INT32_KHR = 0,
    VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_STORAGE_INT64_KHR = 1,
    VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_STORAGE_UINT32_KHR = 2,
    VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_STORAGE_UINT64_KHR = 3,
    VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_STORAGE_FLOAT32_KHR = 4,
    VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_STORAGE_FLOAT64_KHR = 5,
} VkPerformanceCounterStorageKHR;

* 
`VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_STORAGE_INT32_KHR` - the performance counter
storage is a 32-bit signed integer.

* 
`VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_STORAGE_INT64_KHR` - the performance counter
storage is a 64-bit signed integer.

* 
`VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_STORAGE_UINT32_KHR` - the performance
counter storage is a 32-bit unsigned integer.

* 
`VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_STORAGE_UINT64_KHR` - the performance
counter storage is a 64-bit unsigned integer.

* 
`VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_STORAGE_FLOAT32_KHR` - the performance
counter storage is a 32-bit floating-point.

* 
`VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_STORAGE_FLOAT64_KHR` - the performance
counter storage is a 64-bit floating-point.
