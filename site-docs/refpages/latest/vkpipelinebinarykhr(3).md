VkPipelineBinaryKHR - Opaque handle to a pipeline binary object

Pipeline binary objects allow the result of pipeline construction to be
reused between pipelines and between runs of an application.
Reuse is achieved by extracting pipeline binaries from a [VkPipeline](VkPipeline.html)
object, associating them with a corresponding [VkPipelineBinaryKeyKHR](VkPipelineBinaryKeyKHR.html)
and then adding a [VkPipelineBinaryInfoKHR](VkPipelineBinaryInfoKHR.html) to the `pNext` chain of
any `Vk*PipelineCreateInfo` when creating a pipeline.
Pipeline binaries can be reused between runs by extracting
`VkPipelineBinaryDataKHR` from `VkPipelineBinaryKHR` objects, saving
the contents, and then using them to create a `VkPipelineBinaryKHR`
object on subsequent runs.

When creating a pipeline that includes [VkPipelineBinaryInfoKHR](VkPipelineBinaryInfoKHR.html) in the
`pNext` chain, or has the
`VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_2_CAPTURE_DATA_BIT_KHR` flag set, the use of
[VkPipelineCache](VkPipelineCache.html) objects is not allowed.

Pipeline binary objects are represented by `VkPipelineBinaryKHR`
handles:
