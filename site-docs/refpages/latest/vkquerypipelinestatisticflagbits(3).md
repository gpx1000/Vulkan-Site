VkQueryPipelineStatisticFlagBits - Bitmask specifying queried pipeline statistics

Bits which **can** be set in
[VkQueryPoolCreateInfo](VkQueryPoolCreateInfo.html)::`pipelineStatistics` for query pools and in
[VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo](VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo.html)::`pipelineStatistics` for secondary
command buffers, individually enabling pipeline statistics counters, are:

* 
`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_INPUT_ASSEMBLY_VERTICES_BIT` specifies
that queries managed by the pool will count the number of vertices
processed by the [input assembly](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/drawing.html#drawing) stage.
Vertices corresponding to incomplete primitives **may** contribute to the
count.

* 
`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_INPUT_ASSEMBLY_PRIMITIVES_BIT`
specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of
primitives processed by the [input assembly](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/drawing.html#drawing) stage.
If primitive restart is enabled, restarting the primitive topology has
no effect on the count.
Incomplete primitives **may** be counted.

* 
`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_VERTEX_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT`
specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of
vertex shader invocations.
This counter’s value is incremented each time a vertex shader is
[invoked](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/shaders.html#shaders-vertex-execution).

* 
`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_GEOMETRY_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT`
specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of
geometry shader invocations.
This counter’s value is incremented each time a geometry shader is
[invoked](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/shaders.html#shaders-geometry-execution).
In the case of [instanced geometry shaders](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/geometry.html#geometry-invocations), the
geometry shader invocations count is incremented for each separate
instanced invocation.

* 
`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_GEOMETRY_SHADER_PRIMITIVES_BIT`
specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of
primitives generated by geometry shader invocations.
The counter’s value is incremented each time the geometry shader emits a
primitive.
Restarting primitive topology using the SPIR-V instructions
`OpEndPrimitive` or `OpEndStreamPrimitive` has no effect on the
geometry shader output primitives count.

* 
`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_INVOCATIONS_BIT` specifies
that queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives
processed by the [Primitive Clipping](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/vertexpostproc.html#vertexpostproc-clipping) stage of
the pipeline.
The counter’s value is incremented each time a primitive reaches the
primitive clipping stage.

* 
`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_PRIMITIVES_BIT` specifies that
queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives output
by the [Primitive Clipping](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/vertexpostproc.html#vertexpostproc-clipping) stage of the
pipeline.
The counter’s value is incremented each time a primitive passes the
primitive clipping stage.
The actual number of primitives output by the primitive clipping stage
for a particular input primitive is implementation-dependent but **must**
satisfy the following conditions:

If at least one vertex of the input primitive lies inside the clipping
volume, the counter is incremented by one or more.

* 
Otherwise, the counter is incremented by zero or more.

`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FRAGMENT_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT`
specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of
fragment shader invocations.
The counter’s value is incremented each time the fragment shader is
[invoked](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/fragops.html#fragops-shader).

`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_TESSELLATION_CONTROL_SHADER_PATCHES_BIT`
specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of
patches processed by the tessellation control shader.
The counter’s value is incremented once for each patch for which a
tessellation control shader is
[invoked](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/shaders.html#shaders-tessellation-control-execution).

`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_TESSELLATION_EVALUATION_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT`
specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of
invocations of the tessellation evaluation shader.
The counter’s value is incremented each time the tessellation evaluation
shader is [invoked](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/shaders.html#shaders-tessellation-evaluation-execution).

`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_COMPUTE_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT`
specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of
compute shader invocations.
The counter’s value is incremented every time the compute shader is
invoked.
Implementations **may** skip the execution of certain compute shader
invocations or execute additional compute shader invocations for
implementation-dependent reasons as long as the results of rendering
otherwise remain unchanged.

`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_TASK_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT_EXT`
specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of task
shader invocations.
The counter’s value is incremented every time the task shader is
invoked.

`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_MESH_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT_EXT`
specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of mesh
shader invocations.
The counter’s value is incremented every time the mesh shader is
invoked.

These values are intended to measure relative statistics on one
implementation.
Various device architectures will count these values differently.
Any or all counters **may** be affected by the issues described in
[Query Operation](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/queries.html#queries-operation-undefined).

This counting difference is especially true if the pipeline contains mesh or
task shaders, which may affect several of the counters in unexpected ways.

|  | For example, tile-based rendering devices **may** need to replay the scene
| --- | --- |
multiple times, affecting some of the counts. |

If a pipeline has `rasterizerDiscardEnable` enabled, implementations
**may** discard primitives after the final
[pre-rasterization shader stage](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/pipelines.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization).
As a result, if `rasterizerDiscardEnable` is enabled, the clipping input
and output primitives counters **may** not be incremented.

When a pipeline statistics query finishes, the result for that query is
marked as available.
The application **can** copy the result to a buffer (via
`vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults`), or request it be put into host memory (via
`vkGetQueryPoolResults`).
