VkPhysicalDeviceShaderSMBuiltinsFeaturesNV - Structure describing the shader SM Builtins features that can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderSMBuiltinsFeaturesNV` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_NV_shader_sm_builtins
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceShaderSMBuiltinsFeaturesNV {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           shaderSMBuiltins;
} VkPhysicalDeviceShaderSMBuiltinsFeaturesNV;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `shaderSMBuiltins` indicates whether
the implementation supports the SPIR-V `ShaderSMBuiltinsNV`
capability.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderSMBuiltinsFeaturesNV` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderSMBuiltinsFeaturesNV`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceShaderSMBuiltinsFeaturesNV-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceShaderSMBuiltinsFeaturesNV-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_SHADER_SM_BUILTINS_FEATURES_NV`

[VK_NV_shader_sm_builtins](VK_NV_shader_sm_builtins.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
