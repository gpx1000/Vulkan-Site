vkCmdPipelineBarrier2 - Insert a memory dependency

To record a pipeline barrier, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
void vkCmdPipelineBarrier2(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkDependencyInfo*                     pDependencyInfo);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_synchronization2
void vkCmdPipelineBarrier2KHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkDependencyInfo*                     pDependencyInfo);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command is
recorded.

* 
`pDependencyInfo` is a pointer to a [VkDependencyInfo](VkDependencyInfo.html) structure
defining the scopes of this operation.

When [vkCmdPipelineBarrier2](#) is submitted to a queue, it defines memory
dependencies between commands that were submitted to the same queue before
it, and those submitted to the same queue after it.

The first [synchronization scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) and
[access scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) of each memory
dependency defined by `pDependencyInfo` are applied to operations that
occurred earlier in [submission order](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-submission-order).

The second [synchronization scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
and [access scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) of each
memory dependency defined by `pDependencyInfo` are applied to operations
that occurred later in [submission order](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-submission-order).

If `vkCmdPipelineBarrier2` is recorded within a render pass instance,
the synchronization scopes are limited to a subset of operations within the
same subpass or render pass instance.

Valid Usage
