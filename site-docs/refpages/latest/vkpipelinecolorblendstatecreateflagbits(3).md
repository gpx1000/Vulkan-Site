VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateFlagBits - Bitmask specifying additional parameters of an image

Bits which **can** be set in the
[VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo](VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo.html)::`flags` parameter are:

// Provided by VK_EXT_rasterization_order_attachment_access
typedef enum VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateFlagBits {
  // Provided by VK_EXT_rasterization_order_attachment_access
    VK_PIPELINE_COLOR_BLEND_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_ACCESS_BIT_EXT = 0x00000001,
  // Provided by VK_ARM_rasterization_order_attachment_access
    VK_PIPELINE_COLOR_BLEND_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_ACCESS_BIT_ARM = VK_PIPELINE_COLOR_BLEND_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_ACCESS_BIT_EXT,
} VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateFlagBits;

* 
`VK_PIPELINE_COLOR_BLEND_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_ACCESS_BIT_EXT`
specifies that access to color and input attachments will have implicit
framebuffer-local memory dependencies, allowing applications to express
custom blending operations in a fragment shader.

When
`VK_PIPELINE_COLOR_BLEND_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_ACCESS_BIT_EXT`
is included in a pipeline, it forms a framebuffer-local memory dependency
for each fragment generated by draw commands for that pipeline with the
following scopes:

* 
The first [synchronization scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes the `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT`
pipeline stage executed by all previous fragments (as defined by
[primitive order](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/drawing.html#drawing-primitive-order)) in the corresponding
[framebuffer regions](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-framebuffer-regions) including
those generated by the same draw command.

* 
The second [synchronization    scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) includes the `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT`
pipeline stage executed by the generated fragment.

* 
The first [access scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes)
includes all writes to color attachments.

* 
The second [access scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes)
includes all reads from input attachments.
