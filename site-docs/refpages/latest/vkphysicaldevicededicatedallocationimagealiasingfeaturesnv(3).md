VkPhysicalDeviceDedicatedAllocationImageAliasingFeaturesNV - Structure describing dedicated allocation image aliasing features that can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceDedicatedAllocationImageAliasingFeaturesNV`
structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_NV_dedicated_allocation_image_aliasing
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceDedicatedAllocationImageAliasingFeaturesNV {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           dedicatedAllocationImageAliasing;
} VkPhysicalDeviceDedicatedAllocationImageAliasingFeaturesNV;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 

`dedicatedAllocationImageAliasing` indicates that the implementation
supports aliasing of compatible image objects on a dedicated allocation.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceDedicatedAllocationImageAliasingFeaturesNV` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceDedicatedAllocationImageAliasingFeaturesNV`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceDedicatedAllocationImageAliasingFeaturesNV-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceDedicatedAllocationImageAliasingFeaturesNV-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_DEDICATED_ALLOCATION_IMAGE_ALIASING_FEATURES_NV`

[VK_NV_dedicated_allocation_image_aliasing](VK_NV_dedicated_allocation_image_aliasing.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
