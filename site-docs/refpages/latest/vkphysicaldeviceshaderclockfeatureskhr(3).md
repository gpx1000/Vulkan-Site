VkPhysicalDeviceShaderClockFeaturesKHR - Structure describing features supported by VK_KHR_shader_clock

The [VkPhysicalDeviceShaderClockFeaturesKHR](#) structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_shader_clock
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceShaderClockFeaturesKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           shaderSubgroupClock;
    VkBool32           shaderDeviceClock;
} VkPhysicalDeviceShaderClockFeaturesKHR;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `shaderSubgroupClock` indicates
whether shaders **can** perform `Subgroup` scoped clock reads.

* 
 `shaderDeviceClock` indicates whether
shaders **can** perform `Device` scoped clock reads.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderClockFeaturesKHR` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderClockFeaturesKHR`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceShaderClockFeaturesKHR-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceShaderClockFeaturesKHR-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_SHADER_CLOCK_FEATURES_KHR`

[VK_KHR_shader_clock](VK_KHR_shader_clock.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
