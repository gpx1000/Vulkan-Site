VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateFlagBits - Bitmask specifying additional depth/stencil state information.

Bits which **can** be set in the
[VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo](VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo.html)::`flags` parameter are:

// Provided by VK_EXT_rasterization_order_attachment_access
typedef enum VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateFlagBits {
  // Provided by VK_EXT_rasterization_order_attachment_access
    VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_ACCESS_BIT_EXT = 0x00000001,
  // Provided by VK_EXT_rasterization_order_attachment_access
    VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_ACCESS_BIT_EXT = 0x00000002,
  // Provided by VK_ARM_rasterization_order_attachment_access
    VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_ACCESS_BIT_ARM = VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_ACCESS_BIT_EXT,
  // Provided by VK_ARM_rasterization_order_attachment_access
    VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_ACCESS_BIT_ARM = VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_ACCESS_BIT_EXT,
} VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateFlagBits;

* 
`VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_ACCESS_BIT_EXT`
specifies that access to the depth aspects of depth/stencil and input
attachments will have implicit framebuffer-local memory dependencies.

* 
`VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_ACCESS_BIT_EXT`
specifies that access to the stencil aspects of depth/stencil and input
attachments will have implicit framebuffer-local memory dependencies.

When
`VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_ACCESS_BIT_EXT`
is included in a pipeline, it forms a framebuffer-local memory dependency
for each fragment generated by draw commands for that pipeline with the
following scopes:

* 
The first [synchronization scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT` and
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_LATE_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT` pipeline stages executed
by all previous fragments (as defined by [    primitive order](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/drawing.html#drawing-primitive-order)) in the corresponding
[framebuffer regions](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-framebuffer-regions) including
those generated by the same draw command.

* 
The second [synchronization    scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) includes `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT` stage
executed by the generated fragment.

* 
The first [access scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes)
includes all writes to the depth aspect of depth/stencil attachments.

* 
The second [access scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes)
includes all reads from the depth aspect of input attachments.
