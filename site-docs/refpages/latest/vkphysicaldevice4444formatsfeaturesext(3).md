VkPhysicalDevice4444FormatsFeaturesEXT - Structure describing additional 4444 formats supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDevice4444FormatsFeaturesEXT` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_4444_formats
typedef struct VkPhysicalDevice4444FormatsFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           formatA4R4G4B4;
    VkBool32           formatA4B4G4R4;
} VkPhysicalDevice4444FormatsFeaturesEXT;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `formatA4R4G4B4` indicates that the
implementation **must** support using a [VkFormat](VkFormat.html) of
`VK_FORMAT_A4R4G4B4_UNORM_PACK16_EXT` with at least the following
[VkFormatFeatureFlagBits](VkFormatFeatureFlagBits.html):

`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT`

* 
`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_SRC_BIT`

* 
`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_FILTER_LINEAR_BIT`

 `formatA4B4G4R4` indicates that the
implementation **must** support using a [VkFormat](VkFormat.html) of
`VK_FORMAT_A4B4G4R4_UNORM_PACK16_EXT` with at least the following
[VkFormatFeatureFlagBits](VkFormatFeatureFlagBits.html):

* 
`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT`

* 
`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_SRC_BIT`

* 
`VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_FILTER_LINEAR_BIT`

If the `VkPhysicalDevice4444FormatsFeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDevice4444FormatsFeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDevice4444FormatsFeaturesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDevice4444FormatsFeaturesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_4444_FORMATS_FEATURES_EXT`

|  | Although the formats defined by the `[VK_EXT_4444_formats](VK_EXT_4444_formats.html)` extension
| --- | --- |
were promoted to Vulkan 1.3 as optional formats, the
[VkPhysicalDevice4444FormatsFeaturesEXT](#) structure was not promoted to
Vulkan 1.3. |

[VK_EXT_4444_formats](VK_EXT_4444_formats.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
