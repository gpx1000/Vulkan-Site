VkPhysicalDeviceColorWriteEnableFeaturesEXT - Structure describing whether writes to color attachments can be enabled and disabled dynamically

The `VkPhysicalDeviceColorWriteEnableFeaturesEXT` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_color_write_enable
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceColorWriteEnableFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           colorWriteEnable;
} VkPhysicalDeviceColorWriteEnableFeaturesEXT;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `colorWriteEnable` indicates that the
implementation supports the dynamic state
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_COLOR_WRITE_ENABLE_EXT`.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceColorWriteEnableFeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceColorWriteEnableFeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceColorWriteEnableFeaturesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceColorWriteEnableFeaturesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_COLOR_WRITE_ENABLE_FEATURES_EXT`

[VK_EXT_color_write_enable](VK_EXT_color_write_enable.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
