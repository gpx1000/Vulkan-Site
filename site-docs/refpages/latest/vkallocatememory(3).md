vkAllocateMemory - Allocate device memory

To allocate memory objects, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VkResult vkAllocateMemory(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkMemoryAllocateInfo*                 pAllocateInfo,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator,
    VkDeviceMemory*                             pMemory);

* 
`device` is the logical device that owns the memory.

* 
`pAllocateInfo` is a pointer to a [VkMemoryAllocateInfo](VkMemoryAllocateInfo.html)
structure describing parameters of the allocation.
A successfully returned allocation **must** use the requested parameters — no substitution is permitted by the implementation.

* 
`pAllocator` controls host memory allocation as described in the
[Memory Allocation](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/memory.html#memory-allocation) chapter.

* 
`pMemory` is a pointer to a [VkDeviceMemory](VkDeviceMemory.html) handle in which
information about the allocated memory is returned.

Allocations returned by `vkAllocateMemory` are guaranteed to meet any
alignment requirement of the implementation.
For example, if an implementation requires 128 byte alignment for images and
64 byte alignment for buffers, the device memory returned through this
mechanism would be 128-byte aligned.
This ensures that applications **can** correctly suballocate objects of
different types (with potentially different alignment requirements) in the
same memory object.

When memory is allocated, its contents are **undefined** with the following
constraint:

* 
The contents of unprotected memory **must** not be a function of the
contents of data protected memory objects, even if those memory objects
were previously freed.

|  | The contents of memory allocated by one application **should** not be a
| --- | --- |
function of data from protected memory objects of another application, even
if those memory objects were previously freed. |

The maximum number of valid memory allocations that **can** exist
simultaneously within a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) **may** be restricted by implementation-
or platform-dependent limits.
The [`maxMemoryAllocationCount`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/limits.html#limits-maxMemoryAllocationCount)
feature describes the number of allocations that **can** exist simultaneously
before encountering these internal limits.

|  | For historical reasons, if `maxMemoryAllocationCount` is exceeded, some
| --- | --- |
implementations may return `VK_ERROR_TOO_MANY_OBJECTS`.
Exceeding this limit will result in **undefined** behavior, and an application
should not rely on the use of the returned error code in order to identify
when the limit is reached. |

|  | Many protected memory implementations involve complex hardware and system
| --- | --- |
software support, and often have additional and much lower limits on the
number of simultaneous protected memory allocations (from memory types with
the `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_PROTECTED_BIT` property) than for non-protected
memory allocations.
These limits can be system-wide, and depend on a variety of factors outside
of the Vulkan implementation, so they cannot be queried in Vulkan.
Applications **should** use as few allocations as possible from such memory
types by suballocating aggressively, and be prepared for allocation failure
even when there is apparently plenty of capacity remaining in the memory
heap.
As a guideline, the Vulkan conformance test suite requires that at least 80
minimum-size allocations can exist concurrently when no other uses of
protected memory are active in the system. |

Some platforms **may** have a limit on the maximum size of a single allocation.
For example, certain systems **may** fail to create allocations with a size
greater than or equal to 4GB.
Such a limit is implementation-dependent, and if such a failure occurs then
the error `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY` **must** be returned.
This limit is advertised in
[VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance3Properties](VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance3Properties.html)::`maxMemoryAllocationSize`.

The cumulative memory size allocated to a heap **can** be limited by the size
of the specified heap.
In such cases, allocated memory is tracked on a per-device and per-heap
basis.
Some platforms allow overallocation into other heaps.
The overallocation behavior **can** be specified through the
`[VK_AMD_memory_overallocation_behavior](VK_AMD_memory_overallocation_behavior.html)` extension.

If the `memoryTypeIndex` belongs to a heap with the
`VK_MEMORY_HEAP_TILE_MEMORY_BIT_QCOM` bit included in its properties,
this allocation is backed by tile memory, which is an on device cache.
Unlike other heaps, allocations out of the tile memory will always have a
starting address at the start of the heap and its contents are aliased with
all other [VkDeviceMemory](VkDeviceMemory.html) objects bound to the same range while
executing within the same [*tile memory scope*](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/memory.html#memory-tile-heaps).

If the
[VkPhysicalDevicePageableDeviceLocalMemoryFeaturesEXT](VkPhysicalDevicePageableDeviceLocalMemoryFeaturesEXT.html)::`pageableDeviceLocalMemory`
feature is enabled, memory allocations made from a heap that includes
`VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT` in [VkMemoryHeap](VkMemoryHeap.html)::`flags`
**may** be transparently moved to host-local memory allowing multiple
applications to share device-local memory.
If there is no space left in device-local memory when this new allocation is
made, other allocations **may** be moved out transparently to make room.
The operating system will determine which allocations to move to
device-local memory or host-local memory based on platform-specific
criteria.
To help the operating system make good choices, the application **should** set
the appropriate memory priority with [VkMemoryPriorityAllocateInfoEXT](VkMemoryPriorityAllocateInfoEXT.html)
and adjust it as necessary with [vkSetDeviceMemoryPriorityEXT](vkSetDeviceMemoryPriorityEXT.html).
Higher priority allocations will moved to device-local memory first.

Memory allocations made on heaps without the
`VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT` property will not be transparently
promoted to device-local memory by the operating system.
