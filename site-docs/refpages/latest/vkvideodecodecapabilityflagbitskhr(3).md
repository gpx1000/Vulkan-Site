VkVideoDecodeCapabilityFlagBitsKHR - Video decode capability flags

Bits which **may** be set in [VkVideoDecodeCapabilitiesKHR](VkVideoDecodeCapabilitiesKHR.html)::`flags`,
indicating the decoding capabilities supported, are:

// Provided by VK_KHR_video_decode_queue
typedef enum VkVideoDecodeCapabilityFlagBitsKHR {
    VK_VIDEO_DECODE_CAPABILITY_DPB_AND_OUTPUT_COINCIDE_BIT_KHR = 0x00000001,
    VK_VIDEO_DECODE_CAPABILITY_DPB_AND_OUTPUT_DISTINCT_BIT_KHR = 0x00000002,
} VkVideoDecodeCapabilityFlagBitsKHR;

* 
`VK_VIDEO_DECODE_CAPABILITY_DPB_AND_OUTPUT_COINCIDE_BIT_KHR`
specifies support for using the same video picture resource as the
[reconstructed picture](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/videocoding.html#reconstructed-picture) and
[decode output picture](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/videocoding.html#decode-output-picture) in a video decode
operation.

* 
`VK_VIDEO_DECODE_CAPABILITY_DPB_AND_OUTPUT_DISTINCT_BIT_KHR`
specifies support for using distinct video picture resources as the
[reconstructed picture](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/videocoding.html#reconstructed-picture) and
[decode output picture](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/videocoding.html#decode-output-picture) in a video decode
operation.

|  | Some video profiles allow using distinct video picture resources as the
| --- | --- |
reconstructed picture and decode output picture in specific video decode
operations even when the video decode profile does not support
`VK_VIDEO_DECODE_CAPABILITY_DPB_AND_OUTPUT_DISTINCT_BIT_KHR`.
Even if the implementation only reports coincide, the decode output picture
for [film grain](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/videocoding.html#decode-av1-film-grain) enabled frames must be a different
video picture resource from the reconstructed picture because film grain is
applied outside of the coding loop. |

Implementations are only **required** to support one of
`VK_VIDEO_DECODE_CAPABILITY_DPB_AND_OUTPUT_COINCIDE_BIT_KHR` and
`VK_VIDEO_DECODE_CAPABILITY_DPB_AND_OUTPUT_DISTINCT_BIT_KHR`.
Accordingly, applications **should** handle both cases to maximize portability.

|  | If both `VK_VIDEO_DECODE_CAPABILITY_DPB_AND_OUTPUT_COINCIDE_BIT_KHR` and
| --- | --- |
`VK_VIDEO_DECODE_CAPABILITY_DPB_AND_OUTPUT_DISTINCT_BIT_KHR` are
supported, an application can choose to create separate images for decode
DPB and decode output.
E.g. in cases when linear tiling is preferred (and supported) for the decode
output picture and the DPB requires optimal tiling, this avoids the need for
a separate copy at the expense of additional memory bandwidth requirements
during decoding. |
