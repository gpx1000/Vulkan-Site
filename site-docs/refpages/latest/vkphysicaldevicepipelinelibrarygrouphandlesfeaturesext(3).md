## Content

VkPhysicalDevicePipelineLibraryGroupHandlesFeaturesEXT - Structure describing whether querying shader group handles from a pipeline library is supported by the implementation

The `VkPhysicalDevicePipelineLibraryGroupHandlesFeaturesEXT` structure
is defined as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_pipeline_library_group_handles
typedef struct VkPhysicalDevicePipelineLibraryGroupHandlesFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           pipelineLibraryGroupHandles;
} VkPhysicalDevicePipelineLibraryGroupHandlesFeaturesEXT;

This structure describes the following features:

* 

`pipelineLibraryGroupHandles` indicates whether the implementation
supports querying group handles directly from a ray tracing pipeline
library, and guarantees bitwise identical group handles for such
libraries when linked into other pipelines.

If the `VkPhysicalDevicePipelineLibraryGroupHandlesFeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDevicePipelineLibraryGroupHandlesFeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDevicePipelineLibraryGroupHandlesFeaturesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDevicePipelineLibraryGroupHandlesFeaturesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PIPELINE_LIBRARY_GROUP_HANDLES_FEATURES_EXT`
