VkMemoryOverallocationBehaviorAMD - Specify memory overallocation behavior

Possible values for
[VkDeviceMemoryOverallocationCreateInfoAMD](VkDeviceMemoryOverallocationCreateInfoAMD.html)::`overallocationBehavior`
include:

// Provided by VK_AMD_memory_overallocation_behavior
typedef enum VkMemoryOverallocationBehaviorAMD {
    VK_MEMORY_OVERALLOCATION_BEHAVIOR_DEFAULT_AMD = 0,
    VK_MEMORY_OVERALLOCATION_BEHAVIOR_ALLOWED_AMD = 1,
    VK_MEMORY_OVERALLOCATION_BEHAVIOR_DISALLOWED_AMD = 2,
} VkMemoryOverallocationBehaviorAMD;

* 
`VK_MEMORY_OVERALLOCATION_BEHAVIOR_DEFAULT_AMD` lets the
implementation decide if overallocation is allowed.

* 
`VK_MEMORY_OVERALLOCATION_BEHAVIOR_ALLOWED_AMD` specifies
overallocation is allowed if platform permits.

* 
`VK_MEMORY_OVERALLOCATION_BEHAVIOR_DISALLOWED_AMD` specifies the
application is not allowed to allocate device memory beyond the heap
sizes reported by [VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties](VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties.html).
Allocations that are not explicitly made by the application within the
scope of the Vulkan instance are not accounted for.
