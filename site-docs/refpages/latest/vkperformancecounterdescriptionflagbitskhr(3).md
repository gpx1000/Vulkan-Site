VkPerformanceCounterDescriptionFlagBitsKHR - Bitmask specifying usage behavior for a counter

Bits which **can** be set in
[VkPerformanceCounterDescriptionKHR](VkPerformanceCounterDescriptionKHR.html)::`flags`, specifying usage
behavior of a performance counter, are:

// Provided by VK_KHR_performance_query
typedef enum VkPerformanceCounterDescriptionFlagBitsKHR {
    VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_DESCRIPTION_PERFORMANCE_IMPACTING_BIT_KHR = 0x00000001,
    VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_DESCRIPTION_CONCURRENTLY_IMPACTED_BIT_KHR = 0x00000002,
  // VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_DESCRIPTION_PERFORMANCE_IMPACTING_KHR is a legacy alias
    VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_DESCRIPTION_PERFORMANCE_IMPACTING_KHR = VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_DESCRIPTION_PERFORMANCE_IMPACTING_BIT_KHR,
  // VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_DESCRIPTION_CONCURRENTLY_IMPACTED_KHR is a legacy alias
    VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_DESCRIPTION_CONCURRENTLY_IMPACTED_KHR = VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_DESCRIPTION_CONCURRENTLY_IMPACTED_BIT_KHR,
} VkPerformanceCounterDescriptionFlagBitsKHR;

* 
`VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_DESCRIPTION_PERFORMANCE_IMPACTING_BIT_KHR`
specifies that recording the counter **may** have a noticeable performance
impact.

* 
`VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_DESCRIPTION_CONCURRENTLY_IMPACTED_BIT_KHR`
specifies that concurrently recording the counter while other submitted
command buffers are running **may** impact the accuracy of the recording.
