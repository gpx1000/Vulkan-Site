VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features - Structure describing whether the implementation supports maintenance4 functionality

The `VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           maintenance4;
} VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance4
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4FeaturesKHR;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `maintenance4` indicates
that the implementation supports the following:

The application **may** destroy a [VkPipelineLayout](VkPipelineLayout.html) object
immediately after using it to create another object.

* 
`LocalSizeId` **can** be used as an alternative to `LocalSize` to
specify the local workgroup size with specialization constants.

* 
Images created with identical creation parameters will always have the
same alignment requirements.

* 
The size memory requirement of a buffer or image is never greater than
that of another buffer or image created with a greater or equal size.

* 
Push constants do not have to be initialized before they are
dynamically accessed.

* 
The interface matching rules allow a larger output vector to match with
a smaller input vector, with additional values being discarded.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MAINTENANCE_4_FEATURES`

[VK_KHR_maintenance4](VK_KHR_maintenance4.html), [VK_VERSION_1_3](VK_VERSION_1_3.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
