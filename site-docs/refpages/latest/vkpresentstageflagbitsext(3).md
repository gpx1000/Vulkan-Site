VkPresentStageFlagBitsEXT - Bitmask specifying stages of the image presentation process

Presenting an image to the user typically involves multiple stages.
Bits which **can** be set to specify present stages are:

// Provided by VK_EXT_present_timing
typedef enum VkPresentStageFlagBitsEXT {
    VK_PRESENT_STAGE_QUEUE_OPERATIONS_END_BIT_EXT = 0x00000001,
    VK_PRESENT_STAGE_REQUEST_DEQUEUED_BIT_EXT = 0x00000002,
    VK_PRESENT_STAGE_IMAGE_FIRST_PIXEL_OUT_BIT_EXT = 0x00000004,
    VK_PRESENT_STAGE_IMAGE_FIRST_PIXEL_VISIBLE_BIT_EXT = 0x00000008,
} VkPresentStageFlagBitsEXT;

* 
`VK_PRESENT_STAGE_QUEUE_OPERATIONS_END_BIT_EXT` marks the end of the
set of queue operations enqueued by [vkQueuePresentKHR](vkQueuePresentKHR.html) on the
provided `VkQueue` for a presentation request.

* 
`VK_PRESENT_STAGE_REQUEST_DEQUEUED_BIT_EXT` is the stage after which
the presentation request has been dequeued from the swapchain’s internal
presentation request queue, if any, as specified by the present mode
associated with that request.

* 
`VK_PRESENT_STAGE_IMAGE_FIRST_PIXEL_OUT_BIT_EXT` is the stage after
which data for the first pixel of the presentation request associated
with the image has left the presentation engine for a display hardware.

* 
`VK_PRESENT_STAGE_IMAGE_FIRST_PIXEL_VISIBLE_BIT_EXT` is the stage
after which a display hardware has made the first pixel visible for the
presentation request associated with the image to be presented.

|  | The set of queue operations delimited by
| --- | --- |
`VK_PRESENT_STAGE_QUEUE_OPERATIONS_END_BIT_EXT` includes the wait for
the semaphores specified in [VkPresentInfoKHR](VkPresentInfoKHR.html)::`pWaitSemaphores`,
if any, and any work implicitly enqueued by the implementation. |
