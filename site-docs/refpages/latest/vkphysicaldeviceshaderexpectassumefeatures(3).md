## Content

VkPhysicalDeviceShaderExpectAssumeFeatures - Structure describing shader expect assume features that can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderExpectAssumeFeatures` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceShaderExpectAssumeFeatures {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           shaderExpectAssume;
} VkPhysicalDeviceShaderExpectAssumeFeatures;

// Provided by VK_KHR_shader_expect_assume
// Equivalent to VkPhysicalDeviceShaderExpectAssumeFeatures
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceShaderExpectAssumeFeatures VkPhysicalDeviceShaderExpectAssumeFeaturesKHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `shaderExpectAssume`
specifies whether shader modules **can** declare the `ExpectAssumeKHR`
capability.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderExpectAssumeFeatures` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderExpectAssumeFeatures`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceShaderExpectAssumeFeatures-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceShaderExpectAssumeFeatures-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_SHADER_EXPECT_ASSUME_FEATURES`

[VK_KHR_shader_expect_assume](VK_KHR_shader_expect_assume.html), [VK_VERSION_1_4](VK_VERSION_1_4.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
