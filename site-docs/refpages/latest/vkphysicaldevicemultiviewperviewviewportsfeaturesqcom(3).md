VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewPerViewViewportsFeaturesQCOM - Structure describing multiview per view viewports features that can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewPerViewViewportsFeaturesQCOM` structure is
defined as:

// Provided by VK_QCOM_multiview_per_view_viewports
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewPerViewViewportsFeaturesQCOM {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           multiviewPerViewViewports;
} VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewPerViewViewportsFeaturesQCOM;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
 `multiviewPerViewViewports`
indicates that the implementation supports multiview per-view viewports.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewPerViewViewportsFeaturesQCOM` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewPerViewViewportsFeaturesQCOM`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewPerViewViewportsFeaturesQCOM-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewPerViewViewportsFeaturesQCOM-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MULTIVIEW_PER_VIEW_VIEWPORTS_FEATURES_QCOM`
