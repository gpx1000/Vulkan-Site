VkFrontFace - Interpret polygon front-facing orientation

The first step of polygon rasterization is to determine whether the triangle
is *back-facing* or *front-facing*.
This determination is made based on the sign of the (clipped or unclipped)
polygon’s area computed in framebuffer coordinates.
One way to compute this area is:

  

  

where    and    are the x and y
framebuffer coordinates of the ith vertex of the n-vertex
polygon (vertices are numbered starting at zero for the purposes of this
computation) and i ⊕ 1 is (i +  1) mod n.

The interpretation of the sign of a is determined by the
[VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo](VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo.html)::`frontFace` property of
the currently active pipeline.
Possible values are:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef enum VkFrontFace {
    VK_FRONT_FACE_COUNTER_CLOCKWISE = 0,
    VK_FRONT_FACE_CLOCKWISE = 1,
} VkFrontFace;

* 
`VK_FRONT_FACE_COUNTER_CLOCKWISE` specifies that a triangle with
positive area is considered front-facing.

* 
`VK_FRONT_FACE_CLOCKWISE` specifies that a triangle with negative
area is considered front-facing.

Any triangle which is not front-facing is back-facing, including zero-area
triangles.
