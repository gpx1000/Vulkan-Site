VkPhysicalDeviceMultiDrawFeaturesEXT - Structure describing whether the implementation supports multi draw functionality

The `VkPhysicalDeviceMultiDrawFeaturesEXT` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_multi_draw
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMultiDrawFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           multiDraw;
} VkPhysicalDeviceMultiDrawFeaturesEXT;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `multiDraw` indicates that the implementation
supports [vkCmdDrawMultiEXT](vkCmdDrawMultiEXT.html) and [vkCmdDrawMultiIndexedEXT](vkCmdDrawMultiIndexedEXT.html).

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceMultiDrawFeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceMultiDrawFeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMultiDrawFeaturesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMultiDrawFeaturesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MULTI_DRAW_FEATURES_EXT`

[VK_EXT_multi_draw](VK_EXT_multi_draw.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
