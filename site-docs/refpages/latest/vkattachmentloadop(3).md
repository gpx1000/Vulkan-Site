## Content

VkAttachmentLoadOp - Specify how contents of an attachment are treated at the beginning of the subpass where it is first used

Load operations that **can** be used for a render pass are:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef enum VkAttachmentLoadOp {
    VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_LOAD = 0,
    VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR = 1,
    VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE = 2,
  // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4
    VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE = 1000400000,
  // Provided by VK_EXT_load_store_op_none
    VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE_EXT = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_load_store_op_none
    VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE_KHR = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE,
} VkAttachmentLoadOp;

* 
`VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_LOAD` specifies that the previous contents of
the image within the render area will be preserved as the initial
values.
For attachments with a depth/stencil format, this uses the access type
`VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT`.
For attachments with a color format, this uses the access type
`VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT`.

* 
`VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR` specifies that the contents within the
render area will be cleared to a uniform value, which is specified when
a render pass instance is begun.
For attachments with a depth/stencil format, this uses the access type
`VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT`.
For attachments with a color format, this uses the access type
`VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT`.

* 
`VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE` specifies that the previous
contents within the area need not be preserved; the contents of the
attachment will be **undefined** inside the render area.
For attachments with a depth/stencil format, this uses the access type
`VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT`.
For attachments with a color format, this uses the access type
`VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT`.

* 
`VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE` specifies that the previous contents of
the image will be **undefined** inside the render pass.
No access type is used as the image is not accessed.
