VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT - Structure describing the texel buffer alignment features that can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT` structure is
defined as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_texel_buffer_alignment
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           texelBufferAlignment;
} VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `texelBufferAlignment` indicates
whether the implementation uses more specific alignment requirements
advertised in [VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentProperties](VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentProperties.html)
rather than
[VkPhysicalDeviceLimits](VkPhysicalDeviceLimits.html)::`minTexelBufferOffsetAlignment`.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TEXEL_BUFFER_ALIGNMENT_FEATURES_EXT`

[VK_EXT_texel_buffer_alignment](VK_EXT_texel_buffer_alignment.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
