## Content

SubgroupLocalInvocationId - ID of the invocation within a subgroup

`SubgroupLocalInvocationId`

Decorating a variable with the `SubgroupLocalInvocationId` builtin
decoration will make that variable contain the index of the invocation
within the subgroup.
This variable is in range [0,`SubgroupSize`-1].

If `VK_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_REQUIRE_FULL_SUBGROUPS_BIT` is
specified,
or if `module` declares SPIR-V version 1.6 or higher, and the local
workgroup size in the X dimension of the `stage` is a multiple of
[`SubgroupSize`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/interfaces.html#interfaces-builtin-variables-sgs),
full subgroups are enabled for that pipeline stage.
When full subgroups are enabled, subgroups **must** be launched with all
invocations active, i.e., there is an active invocation with
`SubgroupLocalInvocationId` for each value in range
[0,`SubgroupSize`-1].

|  | There is no direct relationship between `SubgroupLocalInvocationId` and
| --- | --- |
`LocalInvocationId` or `LocalInvocationIndex`.
If the pipeline
or shader object
was created with full subgroups applications can compute their own local
invocation index to serve the same purpose:

index = `SubgroupLocalInvocationId` + `SubgroupId` ×
`SubgroupSize`

If full subgroups are not enabled, some subgroups may be dispatched with
inactive invocations that do not correspond to a local workgroup invocation,
making the value of index unreliable. |

|  | `VK_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_REQUIRE_FULL_SUBGROUPS_BIT`
| --- | --- |
and `VK_SHADER_CREATE_REQUIRE_FULL_SUBGROUPS_BIT_EXT` are
effectively deprecated when compiling SPIR-V 1.6 shaders, as this behavior
is the default for Vulkan with SPIR-V 1.6.
This is more aligned with developer expectations, and avoids applications
unexpectedly breaking in the future. |

Valid Usage

* 
[](#VUID-SubgroupLocalInvocationId-SubgroupLocalInvocationId-04380) VUID-SubgroupLocalInvocationId-SubgroupLocalInvocationId-04380

The variable decorated with `SubgroupLocalInvocationId` **must** be
declared using the `Input` `Storage` `Class`

* 
[](#VUID-SubgroupLocalInvocationId-SubgroupLocalInvocationId-04381) VUID-SubgroupLocalInvocationId-SubgroupLocalInvocationId-04381

The variable decorated with `SubgroupLocalInvocationId` **must** be
declared as a scalar 32-bit integer value
