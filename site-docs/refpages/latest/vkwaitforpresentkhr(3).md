vkWaitForPresentKHR - Wait for presentation

When the [`presentWait`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-presentWait) feature is enabled, an
application **can** wait for an image to be presented to the user by first
specifying a presentId for the target presentation by adding a
`VkPresentIdKHR` structure to the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPresentInfoKHR](VkPresentInfoKHR.html) structure and then waiting for that presentation to
complete by calling:

// Provided by VK_KHR_present_wait
VkResult vkWaitForPresentKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkSwapchainKHR                              swapchain,
    uint64_t                                    presentId,
    uint64_t                                    timeout);

* 
`device` is the device associated with `swapchain`.

* 
`swapchain` is the non-retired swapchain on which an image was
queued for presentation.

* 
`presentId` is the presentation presentId to wait for.

* 
`timeout` is the timeout period in units of nanoseconds.
`timeout` is adjusted to the closest value allowed by the
implementation-dependent timeout accuracy, which **may** be substantially
longer than one nanosecond, and **may** be longer than the requested
period.

`vkWaitForPresentKHR` waits for the presentId associated with
`swapchain` to be increased in value so that it is at least equal to
`presentId`.

For `VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR` (or other present mode where images
may be replaced in the presentation queue) any wait of this type associated
with such an image **must** be signaled no later than a wait associated with
the replacing image would be signaled.

When the presentation has completed, the presentId associated with the
related `pSwapchains` entry will be increased in value so that it is at
least equal to the value provided in the `VkPresentIdKHR` structure.

There is no requirement for any precise timing relationship between the
presentation of the image to the user and the update of the presentId value,
but implementations **should** make this as close as possible to the
presentation of the first pixel in the next image being presented to the
user.

The call to `vkWaitForPresentKHR` will block until either the presentId
associated with `swapchain` is greater than or equal to `presentId`,
or `timeout` nanoseconds passes.
When the swapchain becomes OUT_OF_DATE, the call will either return
`VK_SUCCESS` (if the image was delivered to the presentation engine and
may have been presented to the user) or will return early with status
`VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR` (if the image could not be presented to the
user).

As an exception to the normal rules for objects which are externally
synchronized, the `swapchain` passed to `vkWaitForPresentKHR` **may**
be simultaneously used by other threads in calls to functions other than
[vkDestroySwapchainKHR](vkDestroySwapchainKHR.html).
Access to the swapchain data associated with this extension **must** be atomic
within the implementation.
