is the maximum number of local output tasks a single task shader
workgroup can emit.

* 
 `maxMeshWorkGroupCount`[3] is the

 `maxMeshOutputVertices` is the

`meshOutputPerVertexGranularity` is the granularity of vertex

* 

`prefersLocalInvocationVertexOutput` specifies whether writes to the

the primitive output array in a mesh shader yield best performance when
the array index matches `LocalInvocationIndex`.

* 
 `prefersCompactVertexOutput`
specifies whether output vertices should be compacted after custom
culling in the mesh shader for best performance, otherwise keeping the
vertices at their original location may be better.

* 

`prefersCompactPrimitiveOutput` specifies whether output primitives
should be compacted after custom culling in the mesh shader for best
performance, otherwise the use of `CullPrimitiveEXT` may be better.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceMeshShaderPropertiesEXT` structure is included
in the `pNext` chain of [VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2](VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2.html), it is filled
with the implementation-dependent limits.
