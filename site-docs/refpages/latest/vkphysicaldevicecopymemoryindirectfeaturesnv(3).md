VkPhysicalDeviceCopyMemoryIndirectFeaturesNV - Structure describing indirect copy features supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceCopyMemoryIndirectFeaturesNV` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_NV_copy_memory_indirect
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceCopyMemoryIndirectFeaturesNV {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           indirectCopy;
} VkPhysicalDeviceCopyMemoryIndirectFeaturesNV;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `indirectCopy` indicates whether
[indirect copies](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/copies.html#indirect-copies) are supported.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceCopyMemoryIndirectFeaturesNV` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceCopyMemoryIndirectFeaturesNV`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceCopyMemoryIndirectFeaturesNV-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceCopyMemoryIndirectFeaturesNV-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_COPY_MEMORY_INDIRECT_FEATURES_NV`

[VK_NV_copy_memory_indirect](VK_NV_copy_memory_indirect.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
