VkPhysicalDeviceFragmentShadingRateFeaturesKHR - Structure indicating support for variable rate fragment shading

The `VkPhysicalDeviceFragmentShadingRateFeaturesKHR` structure is
defined as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceFragmentShadingRateFeaturesKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           pipelineFragmentShadingRate;
    VkBool32           primitiveFragmentShadingRate;
    VkBool32           attachmentFragmentShadingRate;
} VkPhysicalDeviceFragmentShadingRateFeaturesKHR;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 

`pipelineFragmentShadingRate` indicates that the implementation
supports the [pipeline    fragment shading rate](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/primsrast.html#primsrast-fragment-shading-rate-pipeline).

* 

`primitiveFragmentShadingRate` indicates that the implementation
supports the [primitive    fragment shading rate](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/primsrast.html#primsrast-fragment-shading-rate-primitive).

* 

`attachmentFragmentShadingRate` indicates that the implementation
supports the [attachment    fragment shading rate](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/primsrast.html#primsrast-fragment-shading-rate-attachment).

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceFragmentShadingRateFeaturesKHR` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceFragmentShadingRateFeaturesKHR`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceFragmentShadingRateFeaturesKHR-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceFragmentShadingRateFeaturesKHR-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_FRAGMENT_SHADING_RATE_FEATURES_KHR`

[VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate](VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
