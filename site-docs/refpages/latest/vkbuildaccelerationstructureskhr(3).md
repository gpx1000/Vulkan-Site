vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR - Build an acceleration structure on the host

To build acceleration structures on the host, call:

// Provided by VK_KHR_acceleration_structure
VkResult vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkDeferredOperationKHR                      deferredOperation,
    uint32_t                                    infoCount,
    const VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR* pInfos,
    const VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR* const* ppBuildRangeInfos);

* 
`device` is the `VkDevice` for which the acceleration structures
are being built.

* 
`deferredOperation` is an optional [VkDeferredOperationKHR](VkDeferredOperationKHR.html) to
[request deferral](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations/deferred_host_operations.html#deferred-host-operations-requesting) for this
command.

* 
`infoCount` is the number of acceleration structures to build.
It specifies the number of the `pInfos` structures and
`ppBuildRangeInfos` pointers that **must** be provided.

* 
`pInfos` is a pointer to an array of `infoCount`
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR.html) structures defining
the geometry used to build each acceleration structure.

* 
`ppBuildRangeInfos` is a pointer to an array of `infoCount`
pointers to arrays of [VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR](VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR.html)
structures.
Each `ppBuildRangeInfos`[i] is a pointer to an array of
`pInfos`[i].`geometryCount`
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR](VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR.html) structures defining
dynamic offsets to the addresses where geometry data is stored, as
defined by `pInfos`[i].

This command fulfills the same task as
[vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR.html) but is executed by the host.

The `vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR` command provides the ability to
initiate multiple acceleration structures builds, however there is no
ordering or synchronization implied between any of the individual
acceleration structure builds.

|  | This means that an application **cannot** build a top-level acceleration
| --- | --- |
structure in the same [vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](#) call as the
associated bottom-level or instance acceleration structures are being built.
There also **cannot** be any memory aliasing between any acceleration structure
memories or scratch memories being used by any of the builds. |
