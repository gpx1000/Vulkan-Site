VkPhysicalDevicePipelineBinaryFeaturesKHR - Structure describing support for pipeline binaries

The `VkPhysicalDevicePipelineBinaryFeaturesKHR` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_pipeline_binary
typedef struct VkPhysicalDevicePipelineBinaryFeaturesKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           pipelineBinaries;
} VkPhysicalDevicePipelineBinaryFeaturesKHR;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `pipelineBinaries` indicates that the
implementation supports [Pipeline Binaries](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/pipelines.html#pipelines-binaries).

If the `VkPhysicalDevicePipelineBinaryFeaturesKHR` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDevicePipelineBinaryFeaturesKHR`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDevicePipelineBinaryFeaturesKHR-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDevicePipelineBinaryFeaturesKHR-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PIPELINE_BINARY_FEATURES_KHR`

[VK_KHR_pipeline_binary](VK_KHR_pipeline_binary.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
