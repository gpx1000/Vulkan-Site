VkPhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR - Structure describing whether pipeline executable properties are available

The `VkPhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR` structure
is defined as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties
typedef struct VkPhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           pipelineExecutableInfo;
} VkPhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `pipelineExecutableInfo`
indicates that the implementation supports reporting properties and
statistics about the pipeline executables associated with a compiled
pipeline.

If the `VkPhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PIPELINE_EXECUTABLE_PROPERTIES_FEATURES_KHR`

[VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties](VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
