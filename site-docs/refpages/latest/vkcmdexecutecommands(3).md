vkCmdExecuteCommands - Execute a secondary command buffer from a primary command buffer

Secondary command buffers **must** not be directly submitted to a queue.
To record a secondary command buffer to execute as part of a primary command
buffer, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
void vkCmdExecuteCommands(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    commandBufferCount,
    const VkCommandBuffer*                      pCommandBuffers);

* 
`commandBuffer` is a handle to a primary command buffer that the
secondary command buffers are executed in.

* 
`commandBufferCount` is the length of the `pCommandBuffers`
array.

* 
`pCommandBuffers` is a pointer to an array of
`commandBufferCount` secondary command buffer handles, which are
recorded to execute in the primary command buffer in the order they are
listed in the array.

If any element of `pCommandBuffers` was not recorded with the
`VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_BIT` flag, and it was recorded
into any other primary command buffer which is currently in the
[executable or recording state](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/cmdbuffers.html#commandbuffers-lifecycle), that primary
command buffer becomes [invalid](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/cmdbuffers.html#commandbuffers-lifecycle).

If the [`nestedCommandBuffer`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-nestedCommandBuffer) feature
is enabled it is valid usage for `vkCmdExecuteCommands` to also be
recorded to a [secondary command buffer](../../../../spec/latest/appendices/glossary.html#glossary).
