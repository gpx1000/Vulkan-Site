VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR - Structure describing performance query support for an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_performance_query
typedef struct VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           performanceCounterQueryPools;
    VkBool32           performanceCounterMultipleQueryPools;
} VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 

`performanceCounterQueryPools` indicates whether the implementation
supports performance counter query pools.

* 

`performanceCounterMultipleQueryPools` indicates whether the
implementation supports using multiple performance query pools in a
primary command buffer and secondary command buffers executed within it.

If the `VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDevicePerformanceQueryFeaturesKHR-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PERFORMANCE_QUERY_FEATURES_KHR`

[VK_KHR_performance_query](VK_KHR_performance_query.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
