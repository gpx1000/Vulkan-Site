This extension provides a mechanism for applications to enable driver
support for [render pass transform](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/vertexpostproc.html#vertexpostproc-renderpass-transform).

Mobile devices can be rotated and mobile applications need to render
properly when a device is held in a landscape or portrait orientation.
When the current orientation differs from the device’s native orientation, a
rotation is required so that the “up” direction of the rendered scene
matches the current orientation.

If the Display Processing Unit (DPU) does not natively support rotation, the
Vulkan presentation engine can handle this rotation in a separate
composition pass.
Alternatively, the application can render frames “pre-rotated” to avoid
this extra pass.
The latter is preferred to reduce power consumption and achieve the best
performance because it avoids tasking the GPU with extra work to perform the
copy/rotate operation.

Unlike OpenGL ES, the burden of pre-rotation in Vulkan falls on the
application.
To implement pre-rotation, applications render into swapchain images
matching the device native aspect ratio of the display and “pre-rotate”
the rendering content to match the device’s current orientation.
The burden is more than adjusting the Model View Projection (MVP) matrix in
the vertex shader to account for rotation and aspect ratio.
The coordinate systems of scissors, viewports, derivatives and several
shader built-ins may need to be adapted to produce the correct result.

It is difficult for some game engines to manage this burden; many chose to
simply accept the performance/power overhead of performing rotation in the
presentation engine.

This extension allows applications to achieve the performance benefits of
pre-rotated rendering by moving much of the above-mentioned burden to the
graphics driver.
The following is unchanged with this extension:

* 
Applications create a swapchain matching the native orientation of the
display.
Applications must also set the
[VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR](VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR.html)::`preTransform` equal to the
`currentTransform` as returned by
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR](vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR.html).

The following is changed with this extension:

* 
At [vkCmdBeginRenderPass](vkCmdBeginRenderPass.html), the application provides extension struct
[VkRenderPassTransformBeginInfoQCOM](VkRenderPassTransformBeginInfoQCOM.html) specifying the render pass
transform parameters.

* 
At [vkBeginCommandBuffer](vkBeginCommandBuffer.html) for secondary command buffers, the
application provides extension struct
[VkCommandBufferInheritanceRenderPassTransformInfoQCOM](VkCommandBufferInheritanceRenderPassTransformInfoQCOM.html) specifying
the render pass transform parameters.

* 
The `renderArea`, viewports, scissors, and `fragmentSize` are
all provided in the current (non-rotated) coordinate system.
The implementation will transform those into the native (rotated)
coordinate system.

* 
The implementation is responsible for transforming shader built-ins
(`FragCoord`, `PointCoord`, `SamplePosition`,
`PrimitiveShadingRateKHR`, interpolateAt(), dFdx, dFdy, fWidth) into
the rotated coordinate system.

* 
The implementation is responsible for transforming `position` to the
rotated coordinate system.

* 
If this extension is used with `[VK_QCOM_tile_properties](VK_QCOM_tile_properties.html)`, then
[vkGetFramebufferTilePropertiesQCOM](vkGetFramebufferTilePropertiesQCOM.html) and
[vkGetDynamicRenderingTilePropertiesQCOM](vkGetDynamicRenderingTilePropertiesQCOM.html) return tile properties in
the rotated coordinate space.

1) Some early Adreno drivers (October 2019 through March 2020) advertised
support for this extension but expected VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE values different
from those in the vukan headers.
To cover all Adreno devices on the market, applications need to detect the
driver version and use the appropriate VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE values from the
table below.

The driver version reported in VkPhysicalDeviceProperties.driverVersion is a
`uint32_t` type.
You can decode the `uint32_t` value into a major.minor.patch version as
shown below:

uint32_t  major = ((driverVersion) >> 22);
uint32_t  minor = ((driverVersion) >> 12) & 0x3ff);
uint32_t  patch = ((driverVersion) & 0xfff);

If the Adreno major.minor.patch version is greater than or equal to
512.469.0, then simply use the VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE values as defined in
vulkan_core.h.
If the version is less than or equal to 512.468.0, then use the alternate
values for the two VK_STRUCTURE_TYPEs in the table below.

|  | Adreno Driver Version |
| --- | --- |
|  | 512.468.0 and earlier | 512.469.0 and later |
| VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ RENDER_PASS_TRANSFORM_BEGIN_INFO_QCOM | 1000282000 | 1000282001 |
| VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ COMMAND_BUFFER_INHERITANCE_RENDER_PASS_TRANSFORM_INFO_QCOM | 1000282001 | 1000282000 |

2) Should the extension support only rotations (e.g. 90, 180, 270-degrees),
or also mirror transforms (e.g. vertical flips)? Mobile use cases only
require rotation.
Other display systems such as projectors might require a flipped transform.

**RESOLVED**: In this version of the extension, the functionality is
restricted to 90, 180, and 270-degree rotations to address mobile use cases.

3) How does this extension interact with VK_EXT_fragment_density_map?

**RESOLVED** Some implementations may not be able to support a render pass
that enables both render pass transform and fragment density maps.
For simplicity, this extension disallows enabling both features within a
single render pass.

4) What should this extension be named?

We considered names such as “rotated_rendering”, “pre_rotation” and
others.
Since the functionality is limited to a render pass, it seemed the name
should include “render_pass”.
While the current extension is limited to rotations, it could be extended to
other transforms (like mirror) in the future.

**RESOLVED** The name “render_pass_transform” seems like the most accurate
description of the introduced functionality.

5) How does this extension interact with VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate?

**RESOLVED**: For the same reasons as issue 3, this extension disallows
enabling both `pFragmentShadingRateAttachment` and render pass transform
within a single render pass.

However, pipeline shading rate and primitive shading rate are supported, and
their respective `fragmentSize` and `PrimitiveShadingRateKHR` are
provided in the current (non-rotated) coordinate system.
The implementation is responsible for transforming them to the rotated
coordinate system.

The [set of supported shading rates](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/primsrast.html#primsrast-fragment-shading-rate) **may**
be different per transform.
Supported rates queried from
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFragmentShadingRatesKHR](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFragmentShadingRatesKHR.html) are in the native (rotated)
coordinate system.
This means that the application **must** swap the x/y of the reported rates to
get the set of rates supported for 90 and 270 degree rotation.
