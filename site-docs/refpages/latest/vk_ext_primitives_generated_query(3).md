This extension adds support for a new query type to match OpenGL’s
`GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED` to support layering.

1) Can the query from `VK_EXT_transform_feedback` be used instead?

**RESOLVED**: No.
While the query from VK_EXT_transform_feedback can produce the same results
as in this extension, it is only available while transform feedback is
active.
The OpenGL `GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED` query is independent from transform
feedback.
Emulation through artificial transform feedback is unnecessarily
inefficient.

2) Can `VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_INVOCATIONS_BIT` be used
instead?

**RESOLVED**: It could, but we prefer the extension for simplicity.
Vulkan requires that only one query be active at a time.
If both the `GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED` and the
`GL_CLIPPING_INPUT_PRIMITIVES_ARB` queries need to be simultaneously
enabled, emulation of both through
`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_INVOCATIONS_BIT` is inconvenient.

3) On some hardware, this query cannot be implemented if
`VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo`::`rasterizerDiscardEnable`
is enabled.
How will this be handled?

**RESOLVED**: A feature flag is exposed by this extension for this.
On said hardware, the GL implementation disables rasterizer-discard and
achieves the same effect through other means.
It will not be able to do the same in Vulkan due to lack of state
information.
A feature flag is exposed by this extension so the OpenGL implementation on
top of Vulkan would be able to implement a similar workaround.

4) On some hardware, this query cannot be implemented for non-zero query
indices.
How will this be handled?

**RESOLVED**: A feature flag is exposed by this extension for this.
If this feature is not present, the query from `VK_EXT_transform_feedback`
can be used to the same effect.

5) How is the interaction of this extension with
`transformFeedbackRasterizationStreamSelect` handled?

**RESOLVED**: Disallowed for non-zero streams.
In OpenGL, the rasterization stream is always stream zero.
