VkPhysicalDeviceShaderTileImageFeaturesEXT - Structure describing tile image features supported by the implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderTileImageFeaturesEXT` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_shader_tile_image
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceShaderTileImageFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           shaderTileImageColorReadAccess;
    VkBool32           shaderTileImageDepthReadAccess;
    VkBool32           shaderTileImageStencilReadAccess;
} VkPhysicalDeviceShaderTileImageFeaturesEXT;

The members of the `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderTileImageFeaturesEXT`
structure describe the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 

`shaderTileImageColorReadAccess` indicates that the implementation
supports the `TileImageColorReadAccessEXT` SPIR-V capability.

* 

`shaderTileImageDepthReadAccess` indicates that the implementation
supports the `TileImageDepthReadAccessEXT` SPIR-V capability.

* 

`shaderTileImageStencilReadAccess` indicates that the implementation
supports the `TileImageStencilReadAccessEXT` SPIR-V capability.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderTileImageFeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceShaderTileImageFeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceShaderTileImageFeaturesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceShaderTileImageFeaturesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_SHADER_TILE_IMAGE_FEATURES_EXT`

[VK_EXT_shader_tile_image](VK_EXT_shader_tile_image.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
