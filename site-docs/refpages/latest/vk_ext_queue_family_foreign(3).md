This extension defines a special queue family,
`VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT`, which can be used to transfer ownership
of resources backed by external memory to foreign, external queues.
This is similar to `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR`, defined in
`[VK_KHR_external_memory](VK_KHR_external_memory.html)`.
The key differences between the two are:

* 
The queues represented by `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR` must share
the same physical device and the same driver version as the current
[VkInstance](VkInstance.html).
`VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT` has no such restrictions.
It can represent devices and drivers from other vendors, and can even
represent non-Vulkan-capable devices.

* 
All resources backed by external memory support
`VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR`.
Support for `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT` is more restrictive.

* 
Applications should expect transitions to/from
`VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT` to be more expensive than transitions
to/from `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR`.
