VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR - Structure describing whether the implementation supports maintenance9 functionality

The `VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance9
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           maintenance9;
} VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `maintenance9` indicates that the
implementation supports the following:

The restriction that certain bitfield SPIR-V instructions only operate
on 32-bit integers is relaxed.

* 
The value returned when a vertex shader reads an unbound vertex
attribute is defined by way of the
[     `defaultVertexAttributeValue`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/limits.html#limits-defaultVertexAttributeValue) property.

* 
A new
[VkQueryPoolCreateFlagBits](VkQueryPoolCreateFlagBits.html)::`VK_QUERY_POOL_CREATE_RESET_BIT_KHR`
flag **can** be used to initialize all queries in query pool to the reset
state on creation.

* 
[vkCmdSetEvent2](vkCmdSetEvent2.html) **may** not provide a dependency other than the event
src stage mask.

* 
The effects of image memory barriers and image layout transitions on 3D
images created with `VK_IMAGE_CREATE_2D_ARRAY_COMPATIBLE_BIT` are
limited to only those slices specified in `VkImageSubresourceRange`

* 
A device **can** be created with no queues.
This can be used for compiling pipelines or shaders for the purpose of
filling pipeline caches.

* 
Queue family ownership transfers are no longer required when
transitioning resources created with `VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE`
between queue families that support `VK_QUEUE_GRAPHICS_BIT` and
those that support only `VK_QUEUE_TRANSFER_BIT`.

* 
[`image2DViewOf3DSparse`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/limits.html#limits-image2DViewOf3DSparse) enables
2D views of 3D sparse images.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MAINTENANCE_9_FEATURES_KHR`

[VK_KHR_maintenance9](VK_KHR_maintenance9.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
