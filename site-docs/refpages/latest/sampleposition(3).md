SamplePosition - Position of a shaded sample

`SamplePosition`

Decorating a variable with the `SamplePosition` built-in decoration will
make that variable contain the sub-pixel position of the sample being
shaded.
The top left of the pixel is considered to be at coordinate (0,0) and
the bottom right of the pixel is considered to be at coordinate (1,1).

If the render pass has a fragment density map attachment, the variable will
instead contain the sub-fragment position of the sample being shaded.
The top left of the fragment is considered to be at coordinate (0,0)
and the bottom right of the fragment is considered to be at coordinate
(1,1) for any fragment area.

If a fragment shader entry point’s interface includes an input variable
decorated with `SamplePosition`, [Sample Shading](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/primsrast.html#primsrast-sampleshading) is considered enabled with a `minSampleShading` value of 1.0.

If the current pipeline uses [custom sample locations](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/primsrast.html#primsrast-samplelocations) the value of any variable decorated with the `SamplePosition`
built-in decoration is **undefined**.

Valid Usage

* 
[](#VUID-SamplePosition-SamplePosition-04360) VUID-SamplePosition-SamplePosition-04360

The `SamplePosition` decoration **must** be used only within the
`Fragment` `Execution` `Model`

* 
[](#VUID-SamplePosition-SamplePosition-04361) VUID-SamplePosition-SamplePosition-04361

The variable decorated with `SamplePosition` **must** be declared using
the `Input` `Storage` `Class`

* 
[](#VUID-SamplePosition-SamplePosition-04362) VUID-SamplePosition-SamplePosition-04362

The variable decorated with `SamplePosition` **must** be declared as a
two-component vector of 32-bit floating-point values
