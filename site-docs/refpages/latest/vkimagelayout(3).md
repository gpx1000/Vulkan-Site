The type(s) of device access supported by each layout are:

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED` specifies that the layout is unknown.
Image memory **cannot** be transitioned into this layout.
This layout **can** be used as the `initialLayout` member of
[VkImageCreateInfo](VkImageCreateInfo.html).
This layout **can** be used in place of the current image layout in a
layout transition, but doing so will cause the contents of the image’s
memory to be **undefined**.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED` specifies that an image’s memory is
in a defined layout and **can** be populated by data, but that it has not
yet been initialized by the driver.
Image memory **cannot** be transitioned into this layout.
This layout **can** be used as the `initialLayout` member of
[VkImageCreateInfo](VkImageCreateInfo.html).
This layout is intended to be used as the initial layout for an image
whose contents are written by the host, and hence the data **can** be
written to memory immediately, without first executing a layout
transition.
Currently, `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED` is only useful with
[linear](../../../../spec/latest/appendices/glossary.html#glossary-linear-resource) images because there is not a
standard layout defined for `VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL` images.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL` supports all types of device access,
unless specified otherwise.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ZERO_INITIALIZED_EXT` specifies that an image’s
memory is in a defined layout and is zeroed, but that it has not yet
been initialized by the driver.
Image memory **cannot** be transitioned into this layout.
This layout **can** be used as the `initialLayout` member of
[VkImageCreateInfo](VkImageCreateInfo.html).
This layout is intended to be used as the initial layout for an image
whose contents are already zeroed, either from being explicitly set to
zero by an application or from being allocated with
`VK_MEMORY_ALLOCATE_ZERO_INITIALIZE_BIT_EXT`.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` specifies a layout that **must**
only be used with attachment accesses in the graphics pipeline.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` specifies a layout allowing read
only access as an attachment, or in shaders as a sampled image, combined
image/sampler, or input attachment.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` **must** only be used as a
color or resolve attachment in a `VkFramebuffer`.
This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
the `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT` usage bit enabled.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` specifies a
layout for both the depth and stencil aspects of a depth/stencil format
image allowing read and write access as a depth/stencil attachment.
It is equivalent to `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` and
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` specifies a layout
for both the depth and stencil aspects of a depth/stencil format image
allowing read only access as a depth/stencil attachment or in shaders as
a sampled image, combined image/sampler, or input attachment.

`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_READ_ONLY_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`
specifies a layout for depth/stencil format images allowing read and
write access to the stencil aspect as a stencil attachment, and read
only access to the depth aspect as a depth attachment or in shaders as a
sampled image, combined image/sampler, or input attachment.
It is equivalent to `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` and
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`
specifies a layout for depth/stencil format images allowing read and
write access to the depth aspect as a depth attachment, and read only
access to the stencil aspect as a stencil attachment or in shaders as a
sampled image, combined image/sampler, or input attachment.
It is equivalent to `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` and
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` specifies a layout for
the depth aspect of a depth/stencil format image allowing read and write
access as a depth attachment.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` specifies a layout for the

the `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_VIDEO_ENCODE_SRC_BIT_KHR` usage bit enabled.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_VIDEO_ENCODE_DPB_KHR` **must** only be used as an
output [reconstructed picture](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/videocoding.html#reconstructed-picture) or an input
[reference picture](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/videocoding.html#reference-picture) in a [    video encode operation](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/videocoding.html#video-encode-operations).

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT` **must** only be
used as either a color attachment or depth/stencil attachment and/or
read-only access in a shader as a sampled image, combined image/sampler,
or input attachment.
This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
the `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_BIT_EXT` usage bit
enabled and either the `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT` or
`VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT` and either the
`VK_IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT` or
`VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT` usage bits enabled.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_RENDERING_LOCAL_READ` **must** only be used as either
a storage image, or a color or depth/stencil attachment and an input

the `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_VIDEO_ENCODE_QUANTIZATION_DELTA_MAP_BIT_KHR` or
`VK_IMAGE_USAGE_VIDEO_ENCODE_EMPHASIS_MAP_BIT_KHR` usage bit
enabled.

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TENSOR_ALIASING_ARM` specifies the layout that an
image created with `VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL` **must** be in for it and
a tensor bound to the same aliased range of memory to consistently
interpret the data in memory.
See [Memory Aliasing](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/resources.html#resources-memory-aliasing) for a complete set of rules for
tensor/image aliasing.
This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
`VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TENSOR_ALIASING_BIT_ARM`.

The layout of each image subresource is not a state of the image subresource
itself, but is rather a property of how the data in memory is organized, and
thus for each mechanism of accessing an image in the API the application
**must** specify a parameter or structure member that indicates which image
layout the image subresource(s) are considered to be in when the image will
be accessed.
For transfer commands, this is a parameter to the command (see [Clear Commands](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/clears.html#clears)
and [Copy Commands](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/copies.html#copies)).
For use as a framebuffer attachment, this is a member in the substructures
of the [VkRenderPassCreateInfo](VkRenderPassCreateInfo.html) (see [Render Pass](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/renderpass.html#renderpass)).
For use in a descriptor set, this is a member in the
`VkDescriptorImageInfo` structure (see [Descriptor Set Updates](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/descriptorsets.html#descriptorsets-updates)).

If the [`unifiedImageLayouts`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-unifiedImageLayouts) feature
is enabled, the `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL` image layout **may** be used in
place of the other layouts where allowed with no loss of performance.

|  | `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL` can be a useful catch-all image layout, but
| --- | --- |
there are situations where a dedicated image layout must be used instead.
Some examples include:

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHARED_PRESENT_KHR`

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_VIDEO_DECODE_SRC_KHR`,
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_VIDEO_DECODE_DST_KHR`, and
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_VIDEO_DECODE_DPB_KHR`
without the
[`unifiedImageLayoutsVideo`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-unifiedImageLayoutsVideo)
feature

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_VIDEO_ENCODE_SRC_KHR`,
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_VIDEO_ENCODE_DST_KHR`, and
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_VIDEO_ENCODE_DPB_KHR`
without the
[`unifiedImageLayoutsVideo`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-unifiedImageLayoutsVideo)
feature

* 
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_VIDEO_ENCODE_QUANTIZATION_MAP_KHR`
without the
[`unifiedImageLayoutsVideo`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-unifiedImageLayoutsVideo)
feature |

|  | While `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL` suggests that all types of device access
| --- | --- |
is possible, it does not mean that all patterns of memory accesses are safe
in all situations.
[Common Render Pass Data Races](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/renderpass.html#common-render-pass-data-races) outlines
some situations where data races are unavoidable.
For example, when a subresource is used as both an attachment and a sampled
image (i.e., not an input attachment), [enabling feedback loop](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/renderpass.html#renderpass-feedbackloop) adds extra guarantees which `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL`
alone does not. |
