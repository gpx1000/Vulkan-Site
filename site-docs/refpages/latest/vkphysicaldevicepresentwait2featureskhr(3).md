VkPhysicalDevicePresentWait2FeaturesKHR - Structure indicating support for present wait 2

The `VkPhysicalDevicePresentWait2FeaturesKHR` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_present_wait2
typedef struct VkPhysicalDevicePresentWait2FeaturesKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           presentWait2;
} VkPhysicalDevicePresentWait2FeaturesKHR;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `presentWait2` indicates that the
implementation supports `vkWaitForPresent2KHR`.

If the `VkPhysicalDevicePresentWait2FeaturesKHR` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDevicePresentWait2FeaturesKHR`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDevicePresentWait2FeaturesKHR-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDevicePresentWait2FeaturesKHR-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PRESENT_WAIT_2_FEATURES_KHR`

[VK_KHR_present_wait2](VK_KHR_present_wait2.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
