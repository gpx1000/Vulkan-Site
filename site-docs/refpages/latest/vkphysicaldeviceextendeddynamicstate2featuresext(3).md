VkPhysicalDeviceExtendedDynamicState2FeaturesEXT - Structure describing what extended dynamic state can be used

The `VkPhysicalDeviceExtendedDynamicState2FeaturesEXT` structure is
defined as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceExtendedDynamicState2FeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           extendedDynamicState2;
    VkBool32           extendedDynamicState2LogicOp;
    VkBool32           extendedDynamicState2PatchControlPoints;
} VkPhysicalDeviceExtendedDynamicState2FeaturesEXT;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `extendedDynamicState2` indicates
that the implementation supports the following dynamic states:

`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BIAS_ENABLE`

* 
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_PRIMITIVE_RESTART_ENABLE`

* 
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_RASTERIZER_DISCARD_ENABLE`

`extendedDynamicState2LogicOp` indicates that the implementation
supports the following dynamic state:

* 
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LOGIC_OP_EXT`

`extendedDynamicState2PatchControlPoints` indicates that the
implementation supports the following dynamic state:

* 
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_PATCH_CONTROL_POINTS_EXT`

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceExtendedDynamicState2FeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceExtendedDynamicState2FeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceExtendedDynamicState2FeaturesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceExtendedDynamicState2FeaturesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_EXTENDED_DYNAMIC_STATE_2_FEATURES_EXT`

[VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2](VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
