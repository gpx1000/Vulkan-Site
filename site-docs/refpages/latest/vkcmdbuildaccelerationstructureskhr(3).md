vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR - Build an acceleration structure

To build acceleration structures call:

// Provided by VK_KHR_acceleration_structure
void vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    infoCount,
    const VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR* pInfos,
    const VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR* const* ppBuildRangeInfos);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be
recorded.

* 
`infoCount` is the number of acceleration structures to build.
It specifies the number of the `pInfos` structures and
`ppBuildRangeInfos` pointers that **must** be provided.

* 
`pInfos` is a pointer to an array of `infoCount`
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR.html) structures defining
the geometry used to build each acceleration structure.

* 
`ppBuildRangeInfos` is a pointer to an array of `infoCount`
pointers to arrays of [VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR](VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR.html)
structures.
Each `ppBuildRangeInfos`[i] is a pointer to an array of
`pInfos`[i].`geometryCount`
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR](VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR.html) structures defining
dynamic offsets to the addresses where geometry data is stored, as
defined by `pInfos`[i].

The `vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR` command provides the ability
to initiate multiple acceleration structures builds, however there is no
ordering or synchronization implied between any of the individual
acceleration structure builds.

|  | This means that an application **cannot** build a top-level acceleration
| --- | --- |
structure in the same [vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](#) call as the
associated bottom-level or instance acceleration structures are being built.
There also **cannot** be any memory aliasing between any acceleration structure
memories or scratch memories being used by any of the builds. |

|  | A [VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR](VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR.html) structure is not used when
| --- | --- |
building an acceleration structure with a geometry type of
`VK_GEOMETRY_TYPE_DENSE_GEOMETRY_FORMAT_TRIANGLES_AMDX`. |

|  | The required alignment of the device addresses passed in to parameters below
| --- | --- |
might not be provided by the base address of a [VkBuffer](VkBuffer.html) created with
the correct usage flags and must still be manually aligned by the
application code. |

Accesses to the acceleration structure scratch buffers as identified by the
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR.html)::`scratchData` buffer
device addresses **must** be [synchronized](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies) with
the `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages) and an
[access type](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-access-types) of
(`VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_READ_BIT_KHR` |
`VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_WRITE_BIT_KHR`).
Accesses to each
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR.html)::`srcAccelerationStructure`
and
[VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR.html)::`dstAccelerationStructure`
**must** be [synchronized](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies) with the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages) and an
[access type](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-access-types) of
`VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_READ_BIT_KHR` or
`VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_WRITE_BIT_KHR`, as appropriate.

Accesses to other input buffers as identified by any used values of
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryMotionTrianglesDataNV](VkAccelerationStructureGeometryMotionTrianglesDataNV.html)::`vertexData`,
[VkAccelerationStructureDenseGeometryFormatTrianglesDataAMDX](VkAccelerationStructureDenseGeometryFormatTrianglesDataAMDX.html)::`compressedData`,

[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryAabbsDataKHR](VkAccelerationStructureGeometryAabbsDataKHR.html)::`data`, and
[VkAccelerationStructureGeometryInstancesDataKHR](VkAccelerationStructureGeometryInstancesDataKHR.html)::`data` **must** be
[synchronized](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies) with the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR`
[pipeline stage](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages) and an
[access type](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-access-types) of
`VK_ACCESS_SHADER_READ_BIT`.
