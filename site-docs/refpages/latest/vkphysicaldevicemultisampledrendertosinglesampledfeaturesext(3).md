VkPhysicalDeviceMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledFeaturesEXT - Structure describing whether multisampled rendering to single-sampled attachments is supported

The `VkPhysicalDeviceMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledFeaturesEXT`
structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_multisampled_render_to_single_sampled
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           multisampledRenderToSingleSampled;
} VkPhysicalDeviceMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledFeaturesEXT;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 

`multisampledRenderToSingleSampled` indicates that the
implementation supports multisampled rendering to single-sampled render
pass attachments.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledFeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledFeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledFeaturesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMultisampledRenderToSingleSampledFeaturesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MULTISAMPLED_RENDER_TO_SINGLE_SAMPLED_FEATURES_EXT`

[VK_EXT_multisampled_render_to_single_sampled](VK_EXT_multisampled_render_to_single_sampled.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
