vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR - Set the stack size dynamically for a ray tracing pipeline

To [dynamically set](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/pipelines.html#pipelines-dynamic-state) the stack size for a ray
tracing pipeline, call:

// Provided by VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline
void vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    pipelineStackSize);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be
recorded.

* 
`pipelineStackSize` is the stack size to use for subsequent ray
tracing trace commands.

This command sets the stack size for subsequent ray tracing commands when
the ray tracing pipeline is created with
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_RAY_TRACING_PIPELINE_STACK_SIZE_KHR` set in
[VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo](VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo.html)::`pDynamicStates`.
Otherwise, the stack size is computed as described in
[Ray Tracing Pipeline Stack](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/raytracing.html#ray-tracing-pipeline-stack).

Valid Usage

* 
[](#VUID-vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR-pipelineStackSize-03610) VUID-vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR-pipelineStackSize-03610

`pipelineStackSize` **must** be large enough for any dynamic execution
through the shaders in the ray tracing pipeline used by a subsequent
trace call

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR-commandBuffer-parameter) VUID-vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR-commandBuffer-parameter

 `commandBuffer` **must** be a valid [VkCommandBuffer](VkCommandBuffer.html) handle

* 
[](#VUID-vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR-commandBuffer-recording) VUID-vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR-commandBuffer-recording

 `commandBuffer` **must** be in the [recording state](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/cmdbuffers.html#commandbuffers-lifecycle)

* 
[](#VUID-vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR-commandBuffer-cmdpool) VUID-vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR-commandBuffer-cmdpool

 The `VkCommandPool` that `commandBuffer` was allocated from **must** support compute operations

* 
[](#VUID-vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR-renderpass) VUID-vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR-renderpass

 This command **must** only be called outside of a render pass instance

* 
[](#VUID-vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR-videocoding) VUID-vkCmdSetRayTracingPipelineStackSizeKHR-videocoding

 This command **must** only be called outside of a video coding scope

Host Synchronization

* 
Host access to `commandBuffer` **must** be externally synchronized

* 
Host access to the `VkCommandPool` that `commandBuffer` was allocated from **must** be externally synchronized
