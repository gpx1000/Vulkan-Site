VkExternalFenceFeatureFlagBits - Bitfield describing features of an external fence handle type

Bits which **may** be set in
[VkExternalFenceProperties](VkExternalFenceProperties.html)::`externalFenceFeatures`, indicating
features of a fence external handle type, are:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef enum VkExternalFenceFeatureFlagBits {
    VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_EXPORTABLE_BIT = 0x00000001,
    VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_IMPORTABLE_BIT = 0x00000002,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_external_fence_capabilities
    VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_EXPORTABLE_BIT_KHR = VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_EXPORTABLE_BIT,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_external_fence_capabilities
    VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_IMPORTABLE_BIT_KHR = VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_IMPORTABLE_BIT,
} VkExternalFenceFeatureFlagBits;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_external_fence_capabilities
typedef VkExternalFenceFeatureFlagBits VkExternalFenceFeatureFlagBitsKHR;

* 
`VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_EXPORTABLE_BIT` specifies handles of this
type **can** be exported from Vulkan fence objects.

* 
`VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_IMPORTABLE_BIT` specifies handles of this
type **can** be imported to Vulkan fence objects.
