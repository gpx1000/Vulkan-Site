VkPipelineExecutableStatisticFormatKHR - Enum describing a pipeline executable statistic

The `VkPipelineExecutableStatisticFormatKHR` enum is defined as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties
typedef enum VkPipelineExecutableStatisticFormatKHR {
    VK_PIPELINE_EXECUTABLE_STATISTIC_FORMAT_BOOL32_KHR = 0,
    VK_PIPELINE_EXECUTABLE_STATISTIC_FORMAT_INT64_KHR = 1,
    VK_PIPELINE_EXECUTABLE_STATISTIC_FORMAT_UINT64_KHR = 2,
    VK_PIPELINE_EXECUTABLE_STATISTIC_FORMAT_FLOAT64_KHR = 3,
} VkPipelineExecutableStatisticFormatKHR;

* 
`VK_PIPELINE_EXECUTABLE_STATISTIC_FORMAT_BOOL32_KHR` specifies that
the statistic is returned as a 32-bit boolean value which **must** be
either `VK_TRUE` or `VK_FALSE` and **should** be read from the
`b32` field of `VkPipelineExecutableStatisticValueKHR`.

* 
`VK_PIPELINE_EXECUTABLE_STATISTIC_FORMAT_INT64_KHR` specifies that
the statistic is returned as a signed 64-bit integer and **should** be read
from the `i64` field of `VkPipelineExecutableStatisticValueKHR`.

* 
`VK_PIPELINE_EXECUTABLE_STATISTIC_FORMAT_UINT64_KHR` specifies that
the statistic is returned as an unsigned 64-bit integer and **should** be
read from the `u64` field of
`VkPipelineExecutableStatisticValueKHR`.

* 
`VK_PIPELINE_EXECUTABLE_STATISTIC_FORMAT_FLOAT64_KHR` specifies that
the statistic is returned as a 64-bit floating-point value and **should**
be read from the `f64` field of
`VkPipelineExecutableStatisticValueKHR`.
