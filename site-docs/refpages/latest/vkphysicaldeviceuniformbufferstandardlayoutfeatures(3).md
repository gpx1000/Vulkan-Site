VkPhysicalDeviceUniformBufferStandardLayoutFeatures - Structure indicating support for std430-like packing in uniform buffers

The `VkPhysicalDeviceUniformBufferStandardLayoutFeatures` structure is
defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceUniformBufferStandardLayoutFeatures {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           uniformBufferStandardLayout;
} VkPhysicalDeviceUniformBufferStandardLayoutFeatures;

// Provided by VK_KHR_uniform_buffer_standard_layout
// Equivalent to VkPhysicalDeviceUniformBufferStandardLayoutFeatures
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceUniformBufferStandardLayoutFeatures VkPhysicalDeviceUniformBufferStandardLayoutFeaturesKHR;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 

`uniformBufferStandardLayout` indicates that the implementation
supports the same layouts for uniform buffers as for storage and other
kinds of buffers.
See [Standard Buffer Layout](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/interfaces.html#interfaces-resources-standard-layout).

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceUniformBufferStandardLayoutFeatures` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceUniformBufferStandardLayoutFeatures`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceUniformBufferStandardLayoutFeatures-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceUniformBufferStandardLayoutFeatures-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_STANDARD_LAYOUT_FEATURES`

[VK_KHR_uniform_buffer_standard_layout](VK_KHR_uniform_buffer_standard_layout.html), [VK_VERSION_1_2](VK_VERSION_1_2.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
