VkPipelineExecutableInternalRepresentationKHR - Structure describing the textual form of a pipeline executable internal representation

The `VkPipelineExecutableInternalRepresentationKHR` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties
typedef struct VkPipelineExecutableInternalRepresentationKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    char               name[VK_MAX_DESCRIPTION_SIZE];
    char               description[VK_MAX_DESCRIPTION_SIZE];
    VkBool32           isText;
    size_t             dataSize;
    void*              pData;
} VkPipelineExecutableInternalRepresentationKHR;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`name` is an array of `VK_MAX_DESCRIPTION_SIZE` `char`
containing a null-terminated UTF-8 string which is a short human
readable name for this internal representation.

* 
`description` is an array of `VK_MAX_DESCRIPTION_SIZE` `char`
containing a null-terminated UTF-8 string which is a human readable
description for this internal representation.

* 
`isText` specifies whether the returned data is text or opaque data.
If `isText` is `VK_TRUE` then the data returned in `pData`
is text and is guaranteed to be a null-terminated UTF-8 string.

* 
`dataSize` is an integer related to the size, in bytes, of the
internal representation’s data, as described below.

* 
`pData` is either `NULL` or a pointer to a block of data into which
the implementation will write the internal representation.

If `pData` is `NULL`, then the size, in bytes, of the internal
representation data is returned in `dataSize`.
Otherwise, `dataSize` **must** be the size of the buffer, in bytes, pointed
to by `pData` and on return `dataSize` is overwritten with the
number of bytes of data actually written to `pData` including any
trailing null character.
If `dataSize` is less than the size, in bytes, of the internal
representation’s data, at most `dataSize` bytes of data will be written
to `pData`, and `VK_INCOMPLETE` will be returned instead of
`VK_SUCCESS`, to indicate that not all the available representation was
returned.

If `isText` is `VK_TRUE` and `pData` is not `NULL` and
`dataSize` is not zero, the last byte written to `pData` will be a
null character.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPipelineExecutableInternalRepresentationKHR-sType-sType) VUID-VkPipelineExecutableInternalRepresentationKHR-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_EXECUTABLE_INTERNAL_REPRESENTATION_KHR`

* 
[](#VUID-VkPipelineExecutableInternalRepresentationKHR-pNext-pNext) VUID-VkPipelineExecutableInternalRepresentationKHR-pNext-pNext

 `pNext` **must** be `NULL`
