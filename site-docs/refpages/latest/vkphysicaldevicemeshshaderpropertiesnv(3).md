VkPhysicalDeviceMeshShaderPropertiesNV - Structure describing mesh shading properties

The `VkPhysicalDeviceMeshShaderPropertiesNV` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_NV_mesh_shader
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMeshShaderPropertiesNV {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    uint32_t           maxDrawMeshTasksCount;
    uint32_t           maxTaskWorkGroupInvocations;
    uint32_t           maxTaskWorkGroupSize[3];
    uint32_t           maxTaskTotalMemorySize;
    uint32_t           maxTaskOutputCount;
    uint32_t           maxMeshWorkGroupInvocations;
    uint32_t           maxMeshWorkGroupSize[3];
    uint32_t           maxMeshTotalMemorySize;
    uint32_t           maxMeshOutputVertices;
    uint32_t           maxMeshOutputPrimitives;
    uint32_t           maxMeshMultiviewViewCount;
    uint32_t           meshOutputPerVertexGranularity;
    uint32_t           meshOutputPerPrimitiveGranularity;
} VkPhysicalDeviceMeshShaderPropertiesNV;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`maxDrawMeshTasksCount` is the maximum number of local workgroups
that **can** be launched by a single draw mesh tasks command.
See [Programmable Mesh Shading](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/drawing.html#drawing-mesh-shading).

* 
`maxTaskWorkGroupInvocations` is the maximum total number of task
    shader invocations in a single local workgroup.
    The product of the X, Y, and Z sizes, as specified by the `LocalSize`
or `LocalSizeId`
    execution mode in shader modules or by the object decorated by the
    `WorkgroupSize` decoration, **must** be less than or equal to this
    limit.

* 
`maxTaskWorkGroupSize`[3] is the maximum size of a local task
    workgroup.
    These three values represent the maximum local workgroup size in the X,
    Y, and Z dimensions, respectively.
    The `x`, `y`, and `z` sizes, as specified by the
    `LocalSize`
or `LocalSizeId`
    execution mode or by the object decorated by the `WorkgroupSize`
    decoration in shader modules, **must** be less than or equal to the
    corresponding limit.

* 
`maxTaskTotalMemorySize` is the maximum number of bytes that the
task shader can use in total for shared and output memory combined.

* 
`maxTaskOutputCount` is the maximum number of output tasks a single
task shader workgroup can emit.

* 
`maxMeshWorkGroupInvocations` is the maximum total number of mesh
    shader invocations in a single local workgroup.
    The product of the X, Y, and Z sizes, as specified by the `LocalSize`
or `LocalSizeId`
    execution mode in shader modules or by the object decorated by the
    `WorkgroupSize` decoration, **must** be less than or equal to this
    limit.

* 
`maxMeshWorkGroupSize`[3] is the maximum size of a local mesh
    workgroup.
    These three values represent the maximum local workgroup size in the X,
    Y, and Z dimensions, respectively.
    The `x`, `y`, and `z` sizes, as specified by the
    `LocalSize`
or `LocalSizeId`
    execution mode or by the object decorated by the `WorkgroupSize`
    decoration in shader modules, **must** be less than or equal to the
    corresponding limit.

* 
`maxMeshTotalMemorySize` is the maximum number of bytes that the
mesh shader can use in total for shared and output memory combined.

* 
`maxMeshOutputVertices` is the maximum number of vertices a mesh
shader output can store.

* 
`maxMeshOutputPrimitives` is the maximum number of primitives a mesh
shader output can store.

* 
`maxMeshMultiviewViewCount` is the maximum number of multiview views
a mesh shader can use.

* 
`meshOutputPerVertexGranularity` is the granularity with which mesh
vertex outputs are allocated.
The value can be used to compute the memory size used by the mesh
shader, which **must** be less than or equal to
`maxMeshTotalMemorySize`.

* 
`meshOutputPerPrimitiveGranularity` is the granularity with which
mesh outputs qualified as per-primitive are allocated.
The value can be used to compute the memory size used by the mesh
shader, which **must** be less than or equal to
`maxMeshTotalMemorySize`.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceMeshShaderPropertiesNV` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2](VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2.html), it is filled in with each
corresponding implementation-dependent property.

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MESH_SHADER_PROPERTIES_NV`
