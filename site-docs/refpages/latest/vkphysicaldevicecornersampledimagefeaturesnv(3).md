VkPhysicalDeviceCornerSampledImageFeaturesNV - Structure describing corner sampled image features that can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceCornerSampledImageFeaturesNV` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_NV_corner_sampled_image
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceCornerSampledImageFeaturesNV {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           cornerSampledImage;
} VkPhysicalDeviceCornerSampledImageFeaturesNV;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `cornerSampledImage` specifies
whether images can be created with a
[VkImageCreateInfo](VkImageCreateInfo.html)::`flags` containing
`VK_IMAGE_CREATE_CORNER_SAMPLED_BIT_NV`.
See [Corner-Sampled Images](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/resources.html#resources-images-corner-sampled).

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceCornerSampledImageFeaturesNV` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceCornerSampledImageFeaturesNV`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceCornerSampledImageFeaturesNV-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceCornerSampledImageFeaturesNV-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_CORNER_SAMPLED_IMAGE_FEATURES_NV`

[VK_NV_corner_sampled_image](VK_NV_corner_sampled_image.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
