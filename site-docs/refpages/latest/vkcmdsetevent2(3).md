vkCmdSetEvent2 - Set an event object to signaled state

To signal an event from a device, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
void vkCmdSetEvent2(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkEvent                                     event,
    const VkDependencyInfo*                     pDependencyInfo);

or the equivalent command

// Provided by VK_KHR_synchronization2
void vkCmdSetEvent2KHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkEvent                                     event,
    const VkDependencyInfo*                     pDependencyInfo);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command is
recorded.

* 
`event` is the event that will be signaled.

* 
`pDependencyInfo` is a pointer to a [VkDependencyInfo](VkDependencyInfo.html) structure
defining the first scopes of this operation.

When [vkCmdSetEvent2](#) is submitted to a queue, it defines the first half
of memory dependencies defined by `pDependencyInfo`, as well as an event
signal operation which sets the event to the signaled state.
A memory dependency is defined between the event signal operation and
commands that occur earlier in submission order.

The first [synchronization scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) and
[access scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) are defined by
the union of all the memory dependencies defined by `pDependencyInfo`,
and are applied to all operations that occur earlier in
[submission order](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-submission-order).
[Queue family ownership transfers](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-queue-transfers) and
[image layout transitions](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-image-layout-transitions)
defined by `pDependencyInfo` are also included in the first scopes.

The second [synchronization scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes only the event signal operation, and any
[queue family ownership transfers](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-queue-transfers) and
[image layout transitions](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-image-layout-transitions)
defined by `pDependencyInfo`.

The second [access scope](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes)
includes only [queue family ownership transfers](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-queue-transfers) and [image layout transitions](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-image-layout-transitions).

If `VK_DEPENDENCY_ASYMMETRIC_EVENT_BIT_KHR` is not set in
`pDependencyInfo->dependencyFlags`, future
[vkCmdWaitEvents2](vkCmdWaitEvents2.html) commands rely on all values of each element in
`pDependencyInfo` matching exactly with those used to signal the
corresponding event.
If `VK_DEPENDENCY_ASYMMETRIC_EVENT_BIT_KHR` is set, `vkCmdSetEvent2`
**must** only include the [source stage mask](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages-masks) of the first synchronization scope in
`pDependencyInfo->pMemoryBarriers`[0].`srcStageMask`.
[vkCmdWaitEvents](vkCmdWaitEvents.html) **must** not be used to wait on the result of a signal
operation defined by `vkCmdSetEvent2`.

|  | The extra information provided by [vkCmdSetEvent2](#) compared to
| --- | --- |
[vkCmdSetEvent](vkCmdSetEvent.html) allows implementations to more efficiently schedule the
operations required to satisfy the requested dependencies.
With [vkCmdSetEvent](vkCmdSetEvent.html), the full dependency information is not known until
[vkCmdWaitEvents](vkCmdWaitEvents.html) is recorded, forcing implementations to insert the
required operations at that point and not before. |

If `event` is already in the signaled state when [vkCmdSetEvent2](#) is
executed on the device, then [vkCmdSetEvent2](#) has no effect, no event
signal operation occurs, and no dependency is generated.
