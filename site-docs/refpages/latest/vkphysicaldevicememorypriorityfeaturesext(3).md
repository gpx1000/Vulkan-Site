VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryPriorityFeaturesEXT - Structure describing memory priority features that can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryPriorityFeaturesEXT` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_memory_priority
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryPriorityFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           memoryPriority;
} VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryPriorityFeaturesEXT;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `memoryPriority` indicates that the
implementation supports memory priorities specified at memory allocation
time via [VkMemoryPriorityAllocateInfoEXT](VkMemoryPriorityAllocateInfoEXT.html).

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryPriorityFeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryPriorityFeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryPriorityFeaturesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryPriorityFeaturesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MEMORY_PRIORITY_FEATURES_EXT`

[VK_EXT_memory_priority](VK_EXT_memory_priority.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
