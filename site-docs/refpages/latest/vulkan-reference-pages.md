## Content

This component includes the Vulkan API reference pages, extracted from the
Vulkan Specification.
They do not contain any content not also found in the Specification, but are
a lighter-weight method of presenting individual API descriptions.

The reference pages were formerly published in the Vulkan API Registry.
They have now been integrated into the Vulkan Documentation Project.
