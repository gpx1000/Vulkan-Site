vkGetFenceStatus - Return the status of a fence

To query the status of a fence from the host, call:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VkResult vkGetFenceStatus(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkFence                                     fence);

* 
`device` is the logical device that owns the fence.

* 
`fence` is the handle of the fence to query.

Upon success, `vkGetFenceStatus` returns the status of the fence object,
with the following return codes:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `VK_SUCCESS` | The fence specified by `fence` is signaled. |
| `VK_NOT_READY` | The fence specified by `fence` is unsignaled. |
| `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` | The device has been lost.  See [Lost Device](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-lost-device). |

If a [queue submission](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-submission) command is pending
execution, then the value returned by this command **may** immediately be out
of date.

If the device has been lost (see [Lost Device](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-lost-device)),
`vkGetFenceStatus` **may** return any of the above status codes.
If the device has been lost and `vkGetFenceStatus` is called repeatedly,
it will eventually return either `VK_SUCCESS` or
`VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-vkGetFenceStatus-device-parameter) VUID-vkGetFenceStatus-device-parameter

 `device` **must** be a valid [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) handle

* 
[](#VUID-vkGetFenceStatus-fence-parameter) VUID-vkGetFenceStatus-fence-parameter

 `fence` **must** be a valid [VkFence](VkFence.html) handle

* 
[](#VUID-vkGetFenceStatus-fence-parent) VUID-vkGetFenceStatus-fence-parent

 `fence` **must** have been created, allocated, or retrieved from `device`
