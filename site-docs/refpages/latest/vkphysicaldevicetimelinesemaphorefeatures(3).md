VkPhysicalDeviceTimelineSemaphoreFeatures - Structure describing timeline semaphore features that can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceTimelineSemaphoreFeatures` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceTimelineSemaphoreFeatures {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           timelineSemaphore;
} VkPhysicalDeviceTimelineSemaphoreFeatures;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceTimelineSemaphoreFeatures VkPhysicalDeviceTimelineSemaphoreFeaturesKHR;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `timelineSemaphore`
indicates whether semaphores created with a [VkSemaphoreType](VkSemaphoreType.html) of
`VK_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_TIMELINE` are supported.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceTimelineSemaphoreFeatures` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceTimelineSemaphoreFeatures`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceTimelineSemaphoreFeatures-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceTimelineSemaphoreFeatures-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TIMELINE_SEMAPHORE_FEATURES`

[VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore](VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore.html), [VK_VERSION_1_2](VK_VERSION_1_2.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
