vkGetDeferredOperationMaxConcurrencyKHR - Query the maximum concurrency on a deferred operation

To query the number of additional threads that can usefully be joined to a
deferred operation, call:

// Provided by VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations
uint32_t vkGetDeferredOperationMaxConcurrencyKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkDeferredOperationKHR                      operation);

* 
`device` is the device which owns `operation`.

* 
`operation` is the deferred operation to be queried.

The returned value is the maximum number of threads that can usefully
execute a deferred operation concurrently, reported for the state of the
deferred operation at the point this command is called.
This value is intended to be used to better schedule work onto available
threads.
Applications **can** join any number of threads to the deferred operation and
expect it to eventually complete, though excessive joins **may** return
`VK_THREAD_DONE_KHR` immediately, performing no useful work.

If `operation` is complete,
`vkGetDeferredOperationMaxConcurrencyKHR` returns zero.

If `operation` is currently joined to any threads, the value returned by
this command **may** immediately be out of date.

If `operation` is pending, implementations **must** not return zero unless
at least one thread is currently executing [vkDeferredOperationJoinKHR](vkDeferredOperationJoinKHR.html)
on `operation`.
If there are such threads, the implementation **should** return an estimate of
the number of additional threads which it could profitably use.

Implementations **may** return 232-1 to indicate that the maximum
concurrency is unknown and cannot be easily derived.
Implementations **may** return values larger than the maximum concurrency
available on the host CPU.
In these situations, an application **should** clamp the return value rather
than oversubscribing the machine.

|  | The recommended usage pattern for applications is to query this value once,
| --- | --- |
after deferral, and schedule no more than the specified number of threads to
join the operation.
Each time a joined thread receives `VK_THREAD_IDLE_KHR`, the application
should schedule an additional join at some point in the future, but is not
required to do so. |
