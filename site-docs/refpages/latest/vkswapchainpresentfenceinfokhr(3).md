VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR - Fences associated with a vkQueuePresentKHR operation

The `VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_KHR_swapchain_maintenance1
typedef struct VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    const void*        pNext;
    uint32_t           swapchainCount;
    const VkFence*     pFences;
} VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR;

// Provided by VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1
// Equivalent to VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR
typedef VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoEXT;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`swapchainCount` is the number of swapchains being presented to by
this command.

* 
`pFences` is a list of fences with `swapchainCount` entries.
Each entry **must** be [VK_NULL_HANDLE](VK_NULL_HANDLE.html) or the handle of a fence to
signal when the relevant operations on the associated swapchain have
completed.

The set of *queue operations* defined by queuing an image for presentation,
as well as operations performed by the presentation engine, access the
payloads of objects associated with the presentation operation.
The associated objects include:

* 
The swapchain image, its implicitly bound memory, and any other
resources bound to that memory.

* 
The wait semaphores specified when queuing the image for presentation.

The application **can** provide a fence that the implementation
will signal after all such queue operations have completed, and after the
presentation engine has taken a reference to the payloads of all objects
provided in `VkPresentInfoKHR`
that the presentation engine accesses as part of the present operation.
The fence **may** not wait for the present operation to complete.
For all
binary
wait semaphores imported by the presentation engine using the equivalent of
reference transference, as described in
[Importing Semaphore Payloads](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/synchronization.html#synchronization-semaphores-importing), this
fence **must** not signal until all such semaphore payloads have been reset by
the presentation engine.

The application **can** destroy the wait semaphores associated with a given
presentation operation when at least one of the associated fences is
signaled, and **can** destroy the swapchain when the fences associated with all
past presentation requests referring to that swapchain have signaled.

Fences associated with presentations to the same swapchain on the same
[VkQueue](VkQueue.html) **must** be signaled in the same order as the present operations.

To specify a fence for each swapchain in a present operation, include the
`VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR` structure in the `pNext` chain of
the [VkPresentInfoKHR](VkPresentInfoKHR.html) structure.

Valid Usage

* 
[](#VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-swapchainCount-07757) VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-swapchainCount-07757

`swapchainCount` **must** be equal to
[VkPresentInfoKHR](VkPresentInfoKHR.html)::`swapchainCount`

* 
[](#VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-07758) VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-07758

Each element of `pFences` that is not [VK_NULL_HANDLE](VK_NULL_HANDLE.html) **must** be
unsignaled

* 
[](#VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-07759) VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-07759

Each element of `pFences` that is not [VK_NULL_HANDLE](VK_NULL_HANDLE.html) **must** not
be associated with any other queue command that has not yet completed
execution on that queue

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-sType-sType) VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SWAPCHAIN_PRESENT_FENCE_INFO_KHR`

* 
[](#VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-parameter) VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-parameter

 `pFences` **must** be a valid pointer to an array of `swapchainCount` valid or [VK_NULL_HANDLE](VK_NULL_HANDLE.html) [VkFence](VkFence.html) handles

* 
[](#VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-swapchainCount-arraylength) VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-swapchainCount-arraylength

 `swapchainCount` **must** be greater than `0`
