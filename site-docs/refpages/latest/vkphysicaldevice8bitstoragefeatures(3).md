VkPhysicalDevice8BitStorageFeatures - Structure describing features supported by VK_KHR_8bit_storage

The [VkPhysicalDevice8BitStorageFeatures](#) structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2
typedef struct VkPhysicalDevice8BitStorageFeatures {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           storageBuffer8BitAccess;
    VkBool32           uniformAndStorageBuffer8BitAccess;
    VkBool32           storagePushConstant8;
} VkPhysicalDevice8BitStorageFeatures;

or the equivalent

// Provided by VK_KHR_8bit_storage
typedef VkPhysicalDevice8BitStorageFeatures VkPhysicalDevice8BitStorageFeaturesKHR;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 

    `storageBuffer8BitAccess` indicates whether objects in the
    `StorageBuffer`,
`ShaderRecordBufferKHR`,
    or `PhysicalStorageBuffer`
    storage class with the `Block` decoration **can** have 8-bit integer
    members.
    If this feature is not enabled, 8-bit integer members **must** not be used
    in such
    objects unless [    `shaderUntypedPointer`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-shaderUntypedPointers) is enabled and they are accessed in 32-bit
    multiples or 16-bit multiples if
    [    `storageBuffer16BitAccess`](#extension-features-storageBuffer16BitAccess) is enabled.
    This also indicates whether shader modules **can** declare the
    `StorageBuffer8BitAccess` capability.

* 

`uniformAndStorageBuffer8BitAccess` indicates whether objects in the
`Uniform` storage class with the `Block` decoration **can** have
8-bit integer members.
If this feature is not enabled, 8-bit integer members **must** not be used
in such
objects unless [    `shaderUntypedPointers`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-shaderUntypedPointers) is enabled and they are accessed in 32-bit
multiples or 16-bit multiples if
[    `uniformAndStorageBuffer16BitAccess`](#extension-features-uniformAndStorageBuffer16BitAccess) is enabled.
This also indicates whether shader modules **can** declare the
`UniformAndStorageBuffer8BitAccess` capability.

* 

`storagePushConstant8` indicates whether objects in the
`PushConstant` storage class **can** have 8-bit integer members.
If this feature is not enabled, 8-bit integer members **must** not be used
in such
objects unless [    `shaderUntypedPointers`](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/features.html#features-shaderUntypedPointers) is enabled and they are accessed in 32-bit
multiples or 16-bit multiples if
[    `storagePushConstant16`](#extension-features-storagePushConstant16) is enabled.
This also indicates whether shader modules **can** declare the
`StoragePushConstant8` capability.

If the `VkPhysicalDevice8BitStorageFeatures` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDevice8BitStorageFeatures`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDevice8BitStorageFeatures-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDevice8BitStorageFeatures-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_8BIT_STORAGE_FEATURES`

[VK_KHR_8bit_storage](VK_KHR_8bit_storage.html), [VK_VERSION_1_2](VK_VERSION_1_2.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
