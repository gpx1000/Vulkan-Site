VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT - Structure specifying physical device memory budget and usage

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT` structure is included
in the `pNext` chain of [VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties2](VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties2.html), it is
filled with the current memory budgets and usages.

The `VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT` structure is defined as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_memory_budget
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkDeviceSize       heapBudget[VK_MAX_MEMORY_HEAPS];
    VkDeviceSize       heapUsage[VK_MAX_MEMORY_HEAPS];
} VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT;

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
`heapBudget` is an array of `VK_MAX_MEMORY_HEAPS`
`VkDeviceSize` values in which memory budgets are returned, with
one element for each memory heap.
A heap’s budget is a rough estimate of how much memory the process **can**
allocate from that heap before allocations **may** fail or cause
performance degradation.
The budget includes any currently allocated device memory.

* 
`heapUsage` is an array of `VK_MAX_MEMORY_HEAPS`
`VkDeviceSize` values in which memory usages are returned, with
one element for each memory heap.
A heap’s usage is an estimate of how much memory the process is
currently using in that heap.

The values returned in this structure are not invariant.
The `heapBudget` and `heapUsage` values **must** be zero for array
elements greater than or equal to
[VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties](VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties.html)::`memoryHeapCount`.
The `heapBudget` value **must** be non-zero for array elements less than
[VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties](VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties.html)::`memoryHeapCount`.
The `heapBudget` value **must** be less than or equal to
[VkMemoryHeap](VkMemoryHeap.html)::`size` for each heap.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MEMORY_BUDGET_PROPERTIES_EXT`

[VK_EXT_memory_budget](VK_EXT_memory_budget.html), `VkDeviceSize`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
