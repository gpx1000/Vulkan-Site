VkPhysicalDeviceMapMemoryPlacedFeaturesEXT - Structure describing placed memory map features that can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceMapMemoryPlacedFeaturesEXT` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_map_memory_placed
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMapMemoryPlacedFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           memoryMapPlaced;
    VkBool32           memoryMapRangePlaced;
    VkBool32           memoryUnmapReserve;
} VkPhysicalDeviceMapMemoryPlacedFeaturesEXT;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
 `memoryMapPlaced` indicates that the
implementation supports placing memory maps at application-specified
virtual addresses.

* 
 `memoryMapRangePlaced` indicates
that the implementation supports placing memory maps of a subrange of a
memory object at application-specified virtual addresses.

* 
 `memoryUnmapReserve` indicates that
the implementation supports leaving the memory range reserved when
unmapping a memory object.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceMapMemoryPlacedFeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceMapMemoryPlacedFeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMapMemoryPlacedFeaturesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMapMemoryPlacedFeaturesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MAP_MEMORY_PLACED_FEATURES_EXT`

[VK_EXT_map_memory_placed](VK_EXT_map_memory_placed.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
