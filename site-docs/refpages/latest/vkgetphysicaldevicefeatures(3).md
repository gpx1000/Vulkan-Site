// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
void vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures(
    VkPhysicalDevice                            physicalDevice,
    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures*                   pFeatures);

* 
`physicalDevice` is the physical device from which to query the
supported features.

* 
`pFeatures` is a pointer to a [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures.html)
structure in which the physical device features are returned.
For each feature, a value of `VK_TRUE` specifies that the feature is
supported on this physical device, and `VK_FALSE` specifies that the
feature is not supported.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures-physicalDevice-parameter) VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures-physicalDevice-parameter

 `physicalDevice` **must** be a valid [VkPhysicalDevice](VkPhysicalDevice.html) handle

* 
[](#VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures-pFeatures-parameter) VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures-pFeatures-parameter

 `pFeatures` **must** be a valid pointer to a [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures.html) structure
