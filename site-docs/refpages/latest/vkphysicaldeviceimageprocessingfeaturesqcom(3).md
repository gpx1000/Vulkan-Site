VkPhysicalDeviceImageProcessingFeaturesQCOM - Structure describing image processing features that can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceImageProcessingFeaturesQCOM` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_QCOM_image_processing
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceImageProcessingFeaturesQCOM {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           textureSampleWeighted;
    VkBool32           textureBoxFilter;
    VkBool32           textureBlockMatch;
} VkPhysicalDeviceImageProcessingFeaturesQCOM;

This structure describes the following features:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `textureSampleWeighted` indicates
that the implementation supports shader modules that declare the
`TextureSampleWeightedQCOM` capability.

* 
 `textureBoxFilter` indicates that the
implementation supports shader modules that declare the
`TextureBoxFilterQCOM` capability.

* 
 `textureBlockMatch` indicates that
the implementation supports shader modules that declare the
`TextureBlockMatchQCOM` capability.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceImageProcessingFeaturesQCOM` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceImageProcessingFeaturesQCOM`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceImageProcessingFeaturesQCOM-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceImageProcessingFeaturesQCOM-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_IMAGE_PROCESSING_FEATURES_QCOM`

[VK_QCOM_image_processing](VK_QCOM_image_processing.html), `VkBool32`, [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html)
