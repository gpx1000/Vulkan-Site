vkCmdSetCheckpointNV - Insert diagnostic checkpoint in command stream

Device diagnostic checkpoints are inserted into the command stream by
calling [vkCmdSetCheckpointNV](#).

// Provided by VK_NV_device_diagnostic_checkpoints
void vkCmdSetCheckpointNV(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const void*                                 pCheckpointMarker);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer that will receive the marker

* 
`pCheckpointMarker` is an opaque application-provided value that
will be associated with the checkpoint.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-vkCmdSetCheckpointNV-commandBuffer-parameter) VUID-vkCmdSetCheckpointNV-commandBuffer-parameter

 `commandBuffer` **must** be a valid [VkCommandBuffer](VkCommandBuffer.html) handle

* 
[](#VUID-vkCmdSetCheckpointNV-commandBuffer-recording) VUID-vkCmdSetCheckpointNV-commandBuffer-recording

 `commandBuffer` **must** be in the [recording state](../../../../spec/latest/chapters/cmdbuffers.html#commandbuffers-lifecycle)

* 
[](#VUID-vkCmdSetCheckpointNV-commandBuffer-cmdpool) VUID-vkCmdSetCheckpointNV-commandBuffer-cmdpool

 The `VkCommandPool` that `commandBuffer` was allocated from **must** support `VK_QUEUE_COMPUTE_BIT`, `VK_QUEUE_GRAPHICS_BIT`, or `VK_QUEUE_TRANSFER_BIT` operations

* 
[](#VUID-vkCmdSetCheckpointNV-suspended) VUID-vkCmdSetCheckpointNV-suspended

 This command **must** not be called between suspended render pass instances

* 
[](#VUID-vkCmdSetCheckpointNV-videocoding) VUID-vkCmdSetCheckpointNV-videocoding

 This command **must** only be called outside of a video coding scope

Host Synchronization

* 
Host access to `commandBuffer` **must** be externally synchronized

* 
Host access to the `VkCommandPool` that `commandBuffer` was allocated from **must** be externally synchronized
