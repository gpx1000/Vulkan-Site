This extension builds upon
[VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/appendices/extensions.html#VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve) to
allow for replacing fixed-function resolve with shader-based resolves inside render pass instances.
It additionally adds support for [dynamic rendering](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/appendices/extensions.html#VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering).

Fixed-function resolves do not provide the flexibility needed to handle custom
filtering of a multisample buffer. While users may use a render pass or compute
shader to implement custom resolves, this requires writing the multisampled
buffer to memory which is inefficient for implementations using tiled rendering
techniques which could otherwise avoid this.

Additionally, fixed-function resolves do not allow resolving to a different format,
which is highly desirable in some cases.

With legacy render passes, subpasses within a render pass are allowed to have
different sample counts. This allows users to implement a tiler-efficient
custom resolve by adding a subpass at the end of the render pass that draws a
single quad while reading from the image to resolve as an input attachment.
However this is still not as efficient as fixed-function resolves because tile
space must be reserved for the resolve attachments, and on some implementations
it is possible to avoid this inefficiency by having the last subpass write
directly to memory, providing better performance when drawing a single quad
with no overdraw at the very end of the render pass instance.

With dynamic rendering, there is no equivalent functionality allowing
shader-based resolves.

This extension adds functionality to trigger shader-based resolves inside existing
render pass instances.

It also provides a bit for enlarging a sample region dependency to a fragment region dependency
so that a framebuffer-region dependency can replace a framebuffer-global dependency.

In addition to existing functionality from
[VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/appendices/extensions.html#VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve),
new flags are added along with a new command to enable the same functionality with dynamic rendering.

The ability to resolve to a different format from the original image is also added.

There is a single new feature:

typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceCustomResolveFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           customResolve;
} VkPhysicalDeviceCustomResolveFeaturesEXT;

#define VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_FRAGMENT_REGION_BIT_EXT  ((VkSubpassDescriptionFlagBits)0x00000004)
#define VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_CUSTOM_RESOLVE_BIT_EXT  ((VkSubpassDescriptionFlagBits)0x00000008)

This functions the same as the original `VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve` extension. Specifying
a `VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_CUSTOM_RESOLVE_BIT_EXT` in the last subpass and providing a single sample
attachment indicates to the implementation that this subpass will be used for a
shader-based resolve and it will be more efficient to write directly to the
color attachments.

Dynamic rendering support has been added since the original
[VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/appendices/extensions.html#VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve)
extension was released. Different mechanics are used for this type of render pass.

Unlike legacy render passes, the setups for dynamic rendering shader-based
resolves are identical to fixed function resolves, which is to say that the
same assignments are used for color, depth, and resolve attachments. These
attachments all behave normally during regular rendering passes. Upon switching
to the shader resolve part of the rendering pass, however, the following
changes occur:

* 
Reads from any resolving fragment shader input attachment will still read from the multisampled color or depth attachment

* 
Writes to any resolving fragment shader output will write to the associated single sampled resolve attachment

It is expected that users will draw a single quad with no overdraw and use
[VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/appendices/extensions.html#VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read)
to read from the multisampled color or depth attachments in the shader. Overdraw will produce undefined behavior.

#define VK_RENDERING_FRAGMENT_REGION_BIT_EXT  ((VkRenderingFlagBits)0x00000040)
#define VK_RENDERING_CUSTOM_RESOLVE_BIT_EXT  ((VkRenderingFlagBits)0x00000080)
#define VK_RESOLVE_MODE_CUSTOM_BIT_EXT  ((VkResolveModeFlagBits)0x00000020)

To use shader resolves in a dynamic render pass instance, the render pass must be started using
`VK_RENDERING_CUSTOM_RESOLVE_BIT_EXT`. Attachments which will be resolved by shader must
set `resolveMode` to `VK_RESOLVE_MODE_CUSTOM_BIT_EXT`.

Pipelines and secondary command buffers which will be used at any point in dynamic render passes which perform custom resolves
must chain the following struct into their creation:

* 
For pipelines this is included in the fragment output stage

* 
For secondary command buffers it is chained using `VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo`

* 
For shader objects (only when using fragment density map attachments), it is chained to the `VkShaderCreateInfoEXT` of the fragment stage,
and only `customResolve` is used

typedef struct VkCustomResolveCreateInfoEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    const void*        pNext;
    VkBool32           customResolve;
    uint32_t           colorAttachmentCount;
    const VkFormat*    pColorAttachmentFormats;
    VkFormat           depthAttachmentFormat;
    VkFormat           stencilAttachmentFormat;
} VkCustomResolveCreateInfoEXT;

* 
`customResolve` indicates whether this pipeline will be used for a resolve operation.

* 
`colorAttachmentCount` is the number of entries in pColorAttachmentFormats.

* 
`pColorAttachmentFormats` is a pointer to an array of values defining the format of color resolve attachments used in custom resolves in the same render pass.

* 
`depthAttachmentFormat` is a value defining the format of the depth resolve attachment used in custom resolves in the same render pass.

* 
`stencilAttachmentFormat` is a value defining the format of the stencil resolve attachment used in custom resolves in the same render pass.

In addition to a pipeline barrier which synchronizes the multisample attachment for reading,
the following function must be called in order to begin output to the resolve image:

VKAPI_ATTR void VKAPI_CALL vkCmdBeginCustomResolveEXT(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkBeginCustomResolveInfoEXT*          pBeginCustomResolveInfo);

* 
`commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command is recorded.

* 
`pBeginCustomResolveInfo` is an optional pointer to a `VkBeginCustomResolveInfoEXT` struct which can utilize a `pNext` chain to provide additional info.

typedef struct VkBeginCustomResolveInfoEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    const void*        pNext;
} VkBeginCustomResolveInfoEXT;

* 
`sType` is `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BEGIN_CUSTOM_RESOLVE_INFO_EXT`.

* 
`pNext` can be used to chain a pointer to extend the struct.

The `customResolve` member of `VkCustomResolveCreateInfoEXT` must be `VK_FALSE` for all secondary command buffers and pipelines used prior to `vkCmdBeginCustomResolveEXT`
in a given rendering pass, and it must be `VK_TRUE` for all secondary command buffers and pipelines used afterwards.

All rendering commands recorded from the time that `vkCmdBeginCustomResolveEXT` is called until the
end of the rendering pass will output to the resolve attachments. The contents of all resolve attachments become
undefined upon recording this command.

No. There is no known use case for this functionality, and adding it to the specification would introduce considerable complexity.

On some implementations, in particular when using non-subsampled images, it may
not be possible to have a fragment area larger than (1,1) while also
writing directly to memory. In
[VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/appendices/extensions.html#VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve),
when this occurred it was expected for the implementation to pretend that it was
rendering multiple samples within the original fragment area during the custom
resolve operation. However this meant that trying to compute per-pixel
derivative values by dividing by **FragSizeEXT** would give an incorrect result,
and there were several unhandled interactions elsewhere with conservative
rasterization and sample locations. Instead, this extension adds the ability
for the implementation to reduce the fragment area in a custom resolve
operation. When this happens **FragSizeEXT** must also be reduced. This is
optional, and not expected to happen when using subsampled images.
