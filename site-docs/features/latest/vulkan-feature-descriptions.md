## Content

This component includes all published extension feature descriptions, as well as the original rationale for the Vulkan Roadmap process which resulted in the Roadmap 2022 and Roadmap 2024 milestones. When a Vulkan extension begins development, a “proposal” document is written outlining the proposed API. The proposal is the basis from which specification language is written. When the extension is published, the proposal - now referred to as a “feature description” - is retained to act as supplementary documentation on that extension.
