Table of Contents 1. Problem Statement 2. Solution Space 3. Proposal 4. Issues 4.1. RESOLVED: Is it possible to use VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT image layout with sparse images? This document details API design ideas for the VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout extension, which provides functionality to both render to and sample/fetch from the same subresource of an image in a given render pass. Some applications and API layering efforts need a way to sample from an image that is being rendered to at the same time. This can either be a color attachment or a depth/stencil attachment. Some applications and API layering efforts were using VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL for feedback loops against the specification. The cases that need to be covered are: One-to-one texel-to-pixel interactions. Reading/sampling from a region not currently being written to the image as a color or depth/stencil attachment. Ideally, the solution would also support sampling an image using regular texture operations. Extend input attachments + subpassLoad to support disjoint regions: Using input attachments would also require extra work to patch shaders and re-compile pipelines at draw time, which would result in stutter. Would not support using samplers, which is needed by the layers. Would somehow need to support lod-bias/grad which really does not make sense for subpassLoad. Require image copies for feedback loops used in this manner There can be hundreds of draws with a feedback loop which results in a hundreds of copies and barriers between each draw call, which does not work for performance. Add a new VkImageLayout that supports attachment feedback loops. Add a new layout, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT, that supports attachment feedback loops. It will support all of the following cases: One-to-one texel-to-pixel interactions. Reading/sampling from a region not currently being written to the image as a color or depth/stencil attachment. Sampling or fetching from the image while it is not a color or depth/stencil attachment in the current render pass. Writing to the image as a color or depth/stencil attachment while it is not being sampled or fetched in the current render pass. Yes, there is no difference between sparse and non-sparse images.
