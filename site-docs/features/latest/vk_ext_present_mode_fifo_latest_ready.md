RESOLVED: Is the presentation engine required to wait for the next vblank to return images of obsolete present requests? 4.2. TODO: Should VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR get a corresponding VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_LATEST_READY_EXT? When an application manages to render multiple frames per display refresh cycle, VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR or VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR can introduce some undesired latency, because only the oldest present request in the present queue is processed during each vertical blanking period. This also effectively caps an application’s frame rate to the monitor refresh rate. VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR may cause tearing, so is not a good alternative when tearing is not desired. VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR is currently the only solution to this problem, but brings its own set of issues: * It is challenging to achieve for some implementations. * Most importantly, its semantics preclude any useful interaction with time-based present APIs, such as VK_GOOGLE_display_timing or the one proposed in VK_EXT_present_timing. Because only a single present request is kept in the queue, specifying a present time requires the application to know the precise timing of the request in advance to avoid it replacing an image with an earlier target time that has not been displayed yet. This extension adds a new present mode, VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_LATEST_READY_EXT, which allows the presentation engine to dequeue multiple present requests during vblank, in FIFO order, until encountering a request that is not ready. The image of the last present request to be dequeued is presented to the display. This can increase an application’s frame rate up to (swapchainImageCount - 1) * refreshRate compared to VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR. While this seems similar in concept to VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR, the fundamental difference is that the processing of multiple present requests is done during vblank. From the application perspective, this means that, for example, in a flip-based model, a single vblank may cause multiple swapchain images to be released at once, while VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR is continuously releasing images as new requests become ready. In the absence of a present timing extension, a "ready" request is effectively any request issued after a VkPresentInfoKHR’s `pWaitSemaphores have been signaled. In that context, this extension does not provide more than VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR already offers. However, when using a target present time, the presentation engine would only dequeue all present requests for which the specified present time has lapsed. No, but images must be released in the same (FIFO) order they were presented in. Undecided.
