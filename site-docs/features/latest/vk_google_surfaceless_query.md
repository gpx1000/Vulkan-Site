This proposal regards layering OpenGL over Vulkan, and addresses a discrepancy
where EGL is able to respond to certain queries before a surface is created,
while Vulkan requires a surface for corresponding queries.

An application using EGL can query the list of supported `EGLConfig`s, based on
which it would create an `EGLSurface`.
Additionally, based on the availability of extensions, it can provide a
color space to `eglCreateWindowSurface` at the same time.

In Vulkan, the format and color space information are retrievable from the
`VkSurfaceKHR` through
[`vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR`](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR)
When layering OpenGL over Vulkan, there needs to be a way to query this
information before the surface is created.

Similarly, the OpenGL implementation layer needs to know:

* 
The supported present modes by the platform to be able to correctly expose
the `EGL_KHR_mutable_render_buffer` extension,

* 
Whether protected surfaces are supported to be able to correctly expose the
`EGL_EXT_protected_content` extension.

On some implementations and platforms, the surface formats, color spaces,
present modes and support for protected content are identical for every
surface, and such queries could in fact be answered before a surface is
created.

Currently, no cross-platform solution is known to exist to support layering
OpenGL over Vulkan in this regard.

One solution is to modify the existing relevant queries to allow querying
without a [`VkSurfaceKHR`](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#VkSurfaceKHR).
This works on platforms where this information is truly global, which is
currently the case with Google’s Android and SwiftShader.

Pros:

* 
Trivial to implement and use

Cons:

* 
Works only on some platforms, and cannot be implemented on all platforms.

In VK_GOOGLE_surfaceless_query, the first solution is adopted primarily to
accelerate producing working systems where OpenGL is layered on Vulkan.

With this extension, the `surface` parameter can be `VK_NULL_HANDLE` in the
following:

* 
[`vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR`](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR)

* 
[`vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR`](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR)

* 
`pSurfaceInfo→surface` passed to
[`vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities2KHR`](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities2KHR)
if
[`VkSurfaceProtectedCapabilitiesKHR`](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#VkSurfaceProtectedCapabilitiesKHR)
is chained to `pSurfaceCapabilities`.
In this case, only the protected information is populated, while
[`VkSurfaceCapabilities2KHR`](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#VkSurfaceCapabilities2KHR)`::surfaceCapabilities`
and any other chained structs will have undefined values.

In all the above situations, calling the function with any valid `surface`
parameter will produce identical results to calling it with `VK_NULL_HANDLE`.
