Issues This document proposes adding support for so-called cooperative matrix operations that enables multiple shader invocations to cooperatively and efficiently perform matrix multiplications. A growing number of GPU applications are making use of matrix multiplication operations. Modern GPU HW can take advantage of cross-invocation communication channels or other hardware facilities to implement matrix multiplications operations more efficiently but there is currently no suitable standard SPIR-V/API mechanism to expose these features to applications or libraries. Applications or libraries can use subgroup primitives to write more efficient matrix multiplication kernels but, while technically possible on some hardware, this approach often does not make it possible to write optimal kernels and requires applications to have a lot of device-specific knowledge. NVIDIA exposed with VK_NV_cooperative_matrix a new set of abstractions for such cooperative matrix operations. These include cooperative load and store instructions, a matrix multiplication-addition instruction as well a limited support for element-wise operations on these matrices. Since the release of that extension, a growing body of evidence in the form of discussions and other similar vendor extensions suggests that this approach is suitable for a wide variety of devices and applications and is thus a good candidate for standardization. Work towards a standard extension that exposes abstractions similar as those released under VK_NV_cooperative_matrix. See specifications and presentations for VK_NV_cooperative_matrix. None.
