## Content

The purpose of this chapter is to help users understand the various features Vulkan exposes for atomic operations. To better understand the different extensions, it is first important to be aware of the various types of atomics exposed. Type float int Width 16 bit 32 bit 64 bit Operations loads stores exchange add min max etc. Storage Class StorageBuffer or Uniform (buffer) Workgroup (shared memory) Image (image or sparse image) With Vulkan 1.0 and no extensions, an application is allowed to use 32-bit int type for atomics. This can be used for all supported SPIR-V operations (load, store, exchange, etc). SPIR-V contains some atomic operations that are guarded with the Kernel capability and are not currently allowed in Vulkan. While both GLSL and SPIR-V support the use of atomic counters, Vulkan does not expose the AtomicStorage SPIR-V capability needed to use the AtomicCounter storage class. It was decided that an app can just use OpAtomicIAdd and OpAtomicISub with the value 1 to achieve the same results. The current extensions that expose additional support for atomics are: VK_KHR_shader_atomic_int64 VK_EXT_shader_image_atomic_int64 VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float2 Each explained in more details below. Promoted to core in Vulkan 1.2 GLSL - GL_EXT_shader_atomic_int64 This extension allows for 64-bit int atomic operations for buffers and shared memory. If the Int64Atomics SPIR-V capability is declared, all supported SPIR-V operations can be used with 64-bit int. The two feature bits, shaderBufferInt64Atomics and shaderSharedInt64Atomics, are used to query what storage classes are supported for 64-bit int atomics. shaderBufferInt64Atomics - buffers shaderSharedInt64Atomics - shared memory The shaderBufferInt64Atomics is always guaranteed to be supported if using Vulkan 1.2+ or the extension is exposed. SPV_EXT_shader_image_int64 GLSL_EXT_shader_image_int64 This extension allows for 64-bit int atomic operations for images and sparse images. If the Int64Atomics and Int64ImageEXT SPIR-V capability is declared, all supported SPIR-V operations can be used with 64-bit int on images. This extension exposes both a shaderImageInt64Atomics and sparseImageInt64Atomics feature bit. The sparseImage* feature is an additional feature bit and is only allowed to be used if the shaderImage* bit is enabled as well. Some hardware has a hard time doing atomics on images with sparse resources, therefor the atomic feature is split up to allow sparse images as an additional feature an implementation can expose. SPV_EXT_shader_atomic_float_add GLSL_EXT_shader_atomic_float This extension allows for float atomic operations for buffers, shared memory, images, and sparse images. Only a subset of operations is supported for float types with this extension. The extension lists many feature bits. One way to group them is by *Float*Atomics and *Float*AtomicAdd: The *Float*Atomics features allow for the use of OpAtomicStore, OpAtomicLoad, and OpAtomicExchange for float types. Note the OpAtomicCompareExchange “exchange” operation is not included as the SPIR-V spec only allows int types for it. The *Float*AtomicAdd features allow the use of the two extended SPIR-V operations AtomicFloat32AddEXT and AtomicFloat64AddEXT. From here the rest of the permutations of features fall into the grouping of 32-bit float support: shaderBufferFloat32* - buffers shaderSharedFloat32* - shared memory shaderImageFloat32* - images sparseImageFloat32* - sparse images and 64-bit float support: shaderBufferFloat64* - buffers shaderSharedFloat64* - shared memory OpenGLES OES_shader_image_atomic allowed the use of atomics on r32f for imageAtomicExchange. For porting, an application will want to check for shaderImageFloat32Atomics support to be able to do the same in Vulkan. SPV_EXT_shader_atomic_float_min_max SPV_EXT_shader_atomic_float16_add GLSL_EXT_shader_atomic_float This extension adds 2 additional sets of features missing in VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float First, it adds 16-bit floats for both buffers and shared memory in the same fashion as found above for VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float. shaderBufferFloat16* - buffers shaderSharedFloat16* - shared memory Second, it adds float support for min and max atomic operations (OpAtomicFMinEXT and OpAtomicFMaxEXT) For 16-bit float support (with AtomicFloat16MinMaxEXT capability): shaderBufferFloat16AtomicMinMax - buffers shaderSharedFloat16AtomicMinMax - shared memory For 32-bit float support (with AtomicFloat32MinMaxEXT capability): shaderBufferFloat32AtomicMinMax - buffers shaderSharedFloat32AtomicMinMax - shared memory shaderImageFloat32AtomicMinMax - images sparseImageFloat32AtomicMinMax - sparse images For 64-bit float support (with AtomicFloat64MinMaxEXT capability): shaderBufferFloat64AtomicMinMax - buffers shaderSharedFloat64AtomicMinMax - shared memory
