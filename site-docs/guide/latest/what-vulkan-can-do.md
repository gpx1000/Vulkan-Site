Vulkan can be used to develop applications for many use cases. While Vulkan applications can choose to use a subset of the functionality described below, it was designed so a developer could use all of them in a single API.

2D and 3D graphics are primarily what the Vulkan API is designed for. Vulkan is designed to allow developers to create hardware accelerated graphical applications.

Due to the parallel nature of GPUs, a new style of programming referred to as [GPGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units) can be used to exploit a GPU for computational tasks. Vulkan supports compute variations of `VkQueues`, `VkPipelines`, and more which allow Vulkan to be used for general computation.

Ray tracing is an alternative rendering technique, based around the concept of simulating the physical behavior of light.

Cross-vendor API support for ray tracing was added to Vulkan as a set of extensions in the 1.2.162 specification.
These are primarily [`VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline.html), [`VK_KHR_ray_query`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_KHR_ray_query.html), and [`VK_KHR_acceleration_structure`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_KHR_acceleration_structure.html).

With the [Vulkan Video extensions](https://www.khronos.org/blog/khronos-finalizes-vulkan-video-extensions-for-accelerated-h.264-and-h.265-decode) developers can use hardware accelerated video decoding functionality in realtime. The functionality is exposed through the [VK_KHR_video_queue](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_KHR_video_queue.html), [VK_KHR_video_decode_queue](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_queue.html), [VK_KHR_video_decode_h264](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_h264.html) and [VK_KHR_video_decode_h265](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_h265.html) extensions.

Vulkan Video adheres to the Vulkan philosophy of providing flexible, fine-grained control over video processing scheduling, synchronization, and memory utilization to the application.

Currently, the Vulkan Working Group is looking into how to make Vulkan a first class API for exposing ML compute capabilities of modern GPUs. More information was announced at [Siggraph 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_57aiwJISCI&feature=youtu.be&t=5007).

Vulkan SC ("Safety Critical") aims to bring the graphics and compute capabilities of modern GPUs to safety-critical systems in the automotive, avionics, industrial and medical space. It was publicly [launched on March 1st 2022](https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-releases-vulkan-safety-critical-1.0-specification-to-deliver-safety-critical-graphics-compute) and the specification is available [here](https://www.khronos.org/vulkansc/).
