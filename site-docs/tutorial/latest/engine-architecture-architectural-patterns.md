In this section, we’ll provide a quick overview of common architectural patterns used in modern rendering and game engines, with a focus on Component-Based Architecture which forms the foundation of our Vulkan rendering engine.

Before diving into specific patterns, it’s important to clarify that while we’re building a Vulkan-based rendering engine in this tutorial, many of the architectural patterns we’ll discuss are commonly used in both rendering engines and full game engines. A rendering engine focuses primarily on graphics rendering capabilities, while a full game engine typically includes additional systems like physics, audio, AI, and gameplay logic.

Here’s a brief introduction to the most common architectural patterns used in game and rendering engines:

Layered architecture divides the system into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility. Typical layers include platform abstraction, resource management, rendering, scene management, and application layers.

![Layered Architecture Diagram showing different layers of a rendering engine](../../_images/images/layered_architecture_diagram.png)

**Key Benefits:**
* Clear separation of concerns
* Easier to understand and maintain
* Can replace or modify individual layers without affecting others

For detailed information and implementation examples, see the [Appendix: Layered Architecture](#../Appendix/appendix.adoc#layered-architecture).

Data-Oriented Design (DOD) focuses on organizing data for efficient processing rather than organizing code around objects. It emphasizes cache-friendly memory layouts and bulk processing of data.

![Data-Oriented Design Diagram](../../_images/images/data_oriented_design_diagram.svg)

**Key Benefits:**
* Better cache utilization
* More efficient memory usage
* Easier to parallelize

For detailed information and implementation examples, see the [Appendix: Data-Oriented Design](#../Appendix/appendix.adoc#data-oriented-design).

The Service Locator pattern provides a global point of access to services without coupling consumers to concrete implementations.

![Service Locator Pattern Diagram](../../_images/images/service_locator_pattern_diagram.svg)

**Key Benefits:**
* Decouples service consumers from service providers
* Allows for easy service replacement
* Facilitates testing with mock services

For detailed information and implementation examples, see the [Appendix: Service Locator Pattern](#../Appendix/appendix.adoc#service-locator-pattern).

Component-based architecture is widely used in modern game engines and forms the foundation of our Vulkan rendering engine. It promotes composition over inheritance and allows for more flexible entity design.

* 
**Boxes**: Blue boxes represent Entities, orange boxes represent Components, and green boxes represent Systems

* 
**Line Types**:

Dashed lines show ownership/containment (Entities contain Components)

* 
Solid lines show processing relationships (Systems process specific Components)

**Text**: All text elements use dark colors for visibility in both light and dark modes

**Directional Flow**: Arrows indicate the direction of relationships between elements |

**Entities** - Basic containers that represent objects in the game world.

**Components** - Modular pieces of functionality that can be attached to entities.

**Systems** - Process entities with specific components to implement game logic.

* 
Highly modular and flexible

* 
Avoids deep inheritance hierarchies

* 
Enables data-oriented design

* 
Facilitates parallel processing

// Component base class
class Component {
public:
    virtual ~Component() = default;
    virtual void Update(float deltaTime) {}
};

// Specific component types
class TransformComponent : public Component {
private:
    glm::vec3 position;
    glm::quat rotation;
    glm::vec3 scale;

public:
    // Methods to manipulate transform
};

class MeshComponent : public Component {
private:
    Mesh* mesh;
    Material* material;

public:
    // Methods to render the mesh
};

// Entity class
class Entity {
private:
    std::vector> components;

public:
    template
    T* AddComponent(Args&&... args) {
        static_assert(std::is_base_of::value, "T must derive from Component");
        auto component = std::make_unique(std::forward(args)...);
        T* componentPtr = component.get();
        components.push_back(std::move(component));
        return componentPtr;
    }

    template
    T* GetComponent() {
        for (auto& component : components) {
            if (T* result = dynamic_cast(component.get())) {
                return result;
            }
        }
        return nullptr;
    }

    void Update(float deltaTime) {
        for (auto& component : components) {
            component->Update(deltaTime);
        }
    }
};

For our Vulkan rendering engine, we’ve chosen to focus on component-based architecture for several key reasons:

**Flexibility for Graphics Features**: Component systems allow us to easily add, remove, or swap rendering features (like different shading models, post-processing effects, or lighting techniques) without major refactoring.

**Separation of Rendering Concerns**: Components naturally separate different aspects of rendering (geometry, materials, lighting, cameras) into manageable, reusable pieces.

**Industry Standard**: Most modern rendering engines and graphics frameworks use component-based approaches because they provide the right balance of flexibility, maintainability, and performance.

**Extensibility**: As graphics technology evolves rapidly, component systems make it easier to incorporate new Vulkan features or rendering techniques.

**Compatibility with Data-Oriented Optimizations**: While we’re using a component-based approach, we can still apply data-oriented design principles within our components for performance-critical rendering paths.

While other architectural patterns have their merits, component-based architecture provides the best foundation for a modern, flexible rendering engine. That said, we’ll incorporate aspects of other patterns where appropriate - using layered architecture for our overall engine structure, data-oriented design for performance-critical systems, and service locators for cross-cutting concerns.

We’ve provided a brief overview of common architectural patterns, with a focus on Component-Based Architecture which we’ll use throughout this tutorial. For more detailed information about other architectural patterns, including implementation examples and comparative analysis, see the [Appendix: Detailed Architectural Patterns](#../Appendix/appendix.adoc).

In the next section, we’ll dive deeper into component systems and how to implement them effectively in your engine.
