## Content

This appendix provides in-depth information about common architectural patterns used in modern rendering and game engines. These patterns are referenced in the main Engine Architecture section, with a focus on Component-Based Architecture in the main tutorial.

One of the most fundamental architectural patterns is the layered architecture, where the system is divided into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility.

![Layered Architecture Diagram](../../_images/images/layered_architecture_diagram.png)

**Platform Abstraction Layer** - Provides a consistent interface to platform-specific functionality.

**Resource Management Layer** - Manages loading, caching, and unloading of assets.

**Rendering Layer** - Handles the rendering pipeline, shaders, and graphics API interaction.

**Scene Management Layer** - Manages the scene graph, spatial partitioning, and culling.

**Application Layer** - Handles user input, game logic, and high-level application flow.

* 
Clear separation of concerns

* 
Easier to understand and maintain

* 
Can replace or modify individual layers without affecting others

* 
Facilitates testing of individual layers

// Platform Abstraction Layer
class Platform {
public:
    virtual void Initialize() = 0;
    virtual void* CreateWindow(int width, int height) = 0;
    virtual void ProcessEvents() = 0;
    // ...
};

// Resource Management Layer
class ResourceManager {
public:
    virtual Texture* LoadTexture(const std::string& path) = 0;
    virtual Mesh* LoadMesh(const std::string& path) = 0;
    // ...
};

// Rendering Layer
class Renderer {
public:
    virtual void Initialize(Platform* platform) = 0;
    virtual void RenderScene(Scene* scene) = 0;
    // ...
};

// Scene Management Layer
class SceneManager {
public:
    virtual void AddEntity(Entity* entity) = 0;
    virtual void UpdateScene(float deltaTime) = 0;
    // ...
};

// Application Layer
class Application {
private:
    Platform* platform;
    ResourceManager* resourceManager;
    Renderer* renderer;
    SceneManager* sceneManager;

public:
    void Run() {
        platform->Initialize();
        renderer->Initialize(platform);

        // Main loop
        while (running) {
            platform->ProcessEvents();
            sceneManager->UpdateScene(deltaTime);
            renderer->RenderScene(sceneManager->GetActiveScene());
        }
    }
};

Data-Oriented Design (DOD) focuses on organizing data for efficient processing, rather than organizing code around objects.

![Data-Oriented Design Diagram](../../_images/images/data_oriented_design_diagram.svg)

**Data Layout** - Organizing data for cache-friendly access patterns.

**Systems** - Process data in bulk, often using SIMD instructions.

**Entity-Component-System (ECS)** - A common implementation of DOD principles.

* 
Better cache utilization

* 
More efficient memory usage

* 
Easier to parallelize

* 
Can lead to significant performance improvements

// A simple ECS implementation
struct TransformData {
    std::vector positions;
    std::vector rotations;
    std::vector scales;
};

struct RenderData {
    std::vector meshes;
    std::vector materials;
};

class TransformSystem {
private:
    TransformData& transformData;

public:
    TransformSystem(TransformData& data) : transformData(data) {}

    void Update(float deltaTime) {
        // Process all transforms in bulk
        for (size_t i = 0; i 

The Service Locator pattern provides a global point of access to services without coupling consumers to concrete implementations.

![Service Locator Pattern Diagram](../../_images/images/service_locator_pattern_diagram.svg)

**Service Interface** - Defines the contract for a service.

**Service Provider** - Implements the service interface.

**Service Locator** - Provides access to services.

* 
Decouples service consumers from service providers

* 
Allows for easy service replacement

* 
Facilitates testing with mock services

// Audio service interface
class IAudioService {
public:
    virtual ~IAudioService() = default;
    virtual void PlaySound(const std::string& soundName) = 0;
    virtual void StopSound(const std::string& soundName) = 0;
};

// Concrete audio service
class OpenALAudioService : public IAudioService {
public:
    void PlaySound(const std::string& soundName) override {
        // Implementation using OpenAL
    }

    void StopSound(const std::string& soundName) override {
        // Implementation using OpenAL
    }
};

// Service locator
class ServiceLocator {
private:
    static IAudioService* audioService;
    static IAudioService nullAudioService; // Default null service

public:
    static void Initialize() {
        audioService = &nullAudioService;
    }

    static IAudioService& GetAudioService() {
        return *audioService;
    }

    static void ProvideAudioService(IAudioService* service) {
        if (service == nullptr) {
            audioService = &nullAudioService;
        } else {
            audioService = service;
        }
    }
};

// Usage example
void PlayGameSound() {
    ServiceLocator::GetAudioService().PlaySound("explosion");
}

Deferred rendering separates the geometry and lighting calculations into separate passes, which can be more efficient for scenes with many lights:

**Geometry Pass** - Render scene geometry to G-buffer textures (position, normal, albedo, etc.).

**Lighting Pass** - Apply lighting calculations using G-buffer textures.

Forward+ (or tiled forward) rendering combines the simplicity of forward rendering with some of the efficiency benefits of deferred rendering:

**Light Culling Pass** - Divide the screen into tiles and determine which lights affect each tile.

**Forward Rendering Pass** - Render scene geometry with only the lights that affect each tile.

PBR aims to create more realistic materials by simulating how light interacts with surfaces in the real world:

**Material Parameters** - Define materials using physically meaningful parameters (albedo, metalness, roughness, etc.).

**BRDF** - Use a physically based bidirectional reflectance distribution function.

**Image-Based Lighting** - Use environment maps for ambient lighting.

This section covers advanced techniques for implementing sophisticated camera systems in 3D applications:

* 
**Camera Collision**: Implement a collision volume for the camera to prevent it from passing through walls

* 
**Context-Aware Positioning**: Adjust camera position based on the environment (e.g., zoom out in large open areas, zoom in in tight spaces)

* 
**Intelligent Framing**: Adjust the camera to keep both the character and important objects in frame

* 
**Predictive Following**: Anticipate character movement to reduce camera lag

* 
**Camera Obstruction Transparency**: Make objects that obstruct the view partially transparent

* 
**Dynamic Field of View**: Adjust the FOV based on movement speed or environmental context

These architectural patterns and rendering techniques provide a foundation for designing your rendering engine. In practice, most engines use a combination of these patterns to address different aspects of the system.

When designing your engine architecture, consider:

**Performance Requirements** - Different patterns have different performance characteristics.

**Flexibility Needs** - How much flexibility do you need for future extensions?

**Team Size and Experience** - More complex architectures may be harder to work with for smaller teams.

**Project Scope** - A small project may not need the complexity of a full ECS.
