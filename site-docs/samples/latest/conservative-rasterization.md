**Extension**: [`VK_EXT_conservative_rasterization`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VK_EXT_conservative_rasterization)

Uses conservative rasterization to change the way fragments are generated.
Enables overestimation to generate fragments for every pixel touched instead of only pixels that are fully covered.
