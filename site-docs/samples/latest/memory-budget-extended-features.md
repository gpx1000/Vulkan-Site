## Content

This sample demonstrates how to incorporate the Vulkan memory budget extension.
Memory budget extension helps users to sample the memory budget consumption on each heap from the `physical device`, and is able to tell the `property flag` for each heap.
Which is a proper debug tool to visualize the memory consumption in run-time.

In order to enable usage of memory budget extension features, an instance extension and a device extension were introduced in the constructor of the `MemoryBudget` class, where:

add_instance_extension(VK_KHR_GET_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PROPERTIES_2_EXTENSION_NAME);
add_device_extension(VK_EXT_MEMORY_BUDGET_EXTENSION_NAME);

Memory properties related structure instances were defined and initialized in the header of the `MemoryBudget` class, listed as follows:

VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT physical_device_memory_budget_properties{};
VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties2 device_memory_properties{};

Where, the `sType` and `pNext` variables were defined inside the `initialize_device_memory_properties()` function, such that:

void MemoryBudget::initialize_device_memory_properties()
{
	// Initialize physical device memory budget properties structures variables
	physical_device_memory_budget_properties.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MEMORY_BUDGET_PROPERTIES_EXT;
	physical_device_memory_budget_properties.pNext = nullptr;
	// Initialize physical device memory properties structure variables
	device_memory_properties.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MEMORY_PROPERTIES_2;
	device_memory_properties.pNext = &physical_device_memory_budget_properties;
}

The `sType` of `device_memory_properties` is defined as `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MEMORY_PROPERTIES_2`, and its `pNext` chained in a pointer of the structure instance `physical_device_memory_budget_properties`.
Where, the `sType` of `physical_device_memory_budget_properties` is defined as `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MEMORY_BUDGET_PROPERTIES_EXT` and its `pNext` is defined as a `nullptr`.

Each of the mentioned extension structure instances were defined in the header and initialized in function `initialize_device_memory_properties()`.

In application’s UI overlay, total memory usage and total memory budget will be displayed.
In addition, by pressing down the arrow next to the “Memory Heap Details” tab, it expands a list of all memory usages and budgets from the heap count.
Where all memory properties were converted and displayed in proper units (e.g.,`kilobytes`, `megabytes`, etc.,).
Where:

void MemoryBudget::on_update_ui_overlay(vkb::Drawer &drawer)
{
	converted_memory = update_converted_memory(device_memory_total_usage);
	drawer.text("Total Memory Usage: %.2f %s", converted_memory.data, converted_memory.units.c_str());
	converted_memory = update_converted_memory(device_memory_total_budget);
	drawer.text("Total Memory Budget: %.2f %s", converted_memory.data, converted_memory.units.c_str());

	if (drawer.header("Memory Heap Details"))
	{
		for (int i = 0; i (device_memory_heap_count); i++)
		{
			std::string header = "Memory Heap Index: " + std::to_string(i);
			if (drawer.header(header.c_str()))
			{
				converted_memory = update_converted_memory(physical_device_memory_budget_properties.heapUsage[i]);
				drawer.text("Usage: %.2f %s", converted_memory.data, converted_memory.units.c_str());

				converted_memory = update_converted_memory(physical_device_memory_budget_properties.heapBudget[i]);
				drawer.text("Budget: %.2f %s", converted_memory.data, converted_memory.units.c_str());

				drawer.text("Heap Flag: %s", read_memoryHeap_flags(device_memory_properties.memoryProperties.memoryHeaps[i].flags).c_str());
			}
		}
	}
}

The function `update_device_memory_properties()` measures and updates all memory properties related variables, by calling the `vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties2()` and evaluating the `device_memory_total_usage` and `device_memory_total_budget`, where:

void MemoryBudget::update_device_memory_properties()
{
	vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties2(get_device().get_gpu().get_handle(), &device_memory_properties);
	device_memory_heap_count = device_memory_properties.memoryProperties.memoryHeapCount;
	device_memory_total_usage = 0;
	device_memory_total_budget = 0;
	for (uint32_t i = 0; i 

And the function `update_device_memory_properties()` is assigned to the `prepare_instance_data()`.
Which, in this sample it will only need to be called once after everything was ready in the `prepare_instance_data()`, and before it returns `true`.
