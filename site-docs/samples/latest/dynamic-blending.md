This sample demonstrates the functionality of VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 related to blending. It includes the following features: vkCmdSetColorBlendEnableEXT: toggles blending on and off. vkCmdSetColorBlendEquationEXT: modifies blending operators and factors. vkCmdSetColorBlendAdvancedEXT: utilizes more complex blending operators. vkCmdSetColorWriteMaskEXT: toggles individual channels on and off. To utilize this feature, the device extension VK_EXT_EXTENDED_DYNAMIC_STATE_3_EXTENSION_NAME need to be enabled. The extension VK_EXT_BLEND_OPERATION_ADVANCED_EXTENSION_NAME is required for the advanced blend equations. All presented functions take an array of objects defining their action for subsequent color attachments: The vkCmdSetColorBlendEnableEXT function expects an array of booleans to toggle blending. The vkCmdSetColorBlendEquationEXT function expects an array of VkColorBlendEquationEXT objects which determine operators and factors for color and alpha blending. The VkCmdSetColorBlendAdvancedEXT function expects an array of VkColorBlendAdvancedEXT objects, which determine blending operators and premultiplication for color blending. The vkCmdSetColorWriteMaskEXT function expects an array of VkColorComponentFlags objects. These objects can be created by combining the desired color bit flags using bitwise oring. The sample demonstrates how to set up an application to work with this extension: Enabling the extension. Setting parameters for the presented methods. The sample demonstrates how the use of each operator affects color blending. https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/vkCmdSetColorBlendEnableEXT.html https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/vkCmdSetColorBlendEquationEXT.html https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/vkCmdSetColorBlendAdvancedEXT.html https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/vkCmdSetColorWriteMaskEXT.html
