## Content

This sample demonstrates the extension `VK_EXT_calibrated_timestamps`.
The calibrated timestamps profiles any given portion of code, unlike timestamp queries, which only profiles an entire graphic queue.

To enable the `VK_EXT_calibrated_timestamps` extension, `VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2` must be enabled.

This sample is built upon the framework of the Vulkan Sample `HDR`.
We demonstrate using calibrated timestamps  over the build_command_buffers function.

A timestamp is being sampled via the calibrated timestamp extension.
In general, one must take two timestamps in order to measure the time elapsed within a block of code.

Each time domain is different, and the measurement of their associated timestamp periods may vary.
The precision of timestamps is calibrated by max deviations.

A list of time domains can be extracted by using `vkGetPhysicalDeviceCalibrateableTimeDomainsEXT`.
And the Vulkan time domain is defined by the enum `VkTimeDomainEXT`
